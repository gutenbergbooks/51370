<h1>Preface.</h1>
<br>
<p>
Great servants of God have seldom been
understood in their lifetime. Persecution
has assailed them often, from quarters
where help would be expected in their
defence. Even holy souls are sometimes mistaken
about the particular line of virtue which distinguishes
their contemporaries from themselves. St. John of
the Cross, St. Joseph Calasanctius, and St. Alphonsus
Liguori, have had the close of their lives embittered,
as we might call it, by domestic persecution; and it
was some time before their splendour, as they vanished
from the horizon of life, rose again to its zenith, and
outshone its former glory. If the impartial eye, with
which we read their actions, fails to find a plea for
the manner they have been dealt with, let us remember
that we have no interests at stake&mdash;no false
colouring of passion to blind us. Death, indeed,
does not always mow down mistaken notions with
the life of him about whom they are taken up. We
must, however, be thankful that it slays so many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
wrong impressions, and attribute the residue to other
causes.
</p>
<p>
Justice to the dead is an impulse of nature; and
those who would qualify praise of the living by the
mention of unworthy actions or inferior motives, will
qualify blame of the dead by a contrary proceeding.
This instinct has its golden mean as well as every
other. If an ancient Greek ostracised a man because
he was praised by every one, many moderns will defend
a man because he is similarly blamed.
</p>
<p>
Whenever there exists a difference of opinion about
a man during life, it requires some length of time
after he has departed, for prejudice to settle to the
bottom, and allow his genuine character to be seen
through clearly.
</p>
<p>
These facts, and the experience of history, lead us
to conclude that a man's life cannot be impartially
written when his memory is yet fresh in people's
minds. Thousands have had opportunities of judging,
and bring their impressions to compare them with the
page that records the actions from which they were
taken; and if they be different from the idea the
biographer intends to convey, it is not probable
that, in every case, their possessors will be content to
lay them aside. It is supposed, moreover, that a
biographer owes a kind of vassalage to his subject&mdash;
that he is obliged to defend him through thick and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
thin&mdash;in good and evil report. He is obliged, according
to traditionary, though arbitrary laws, to
suppress whatever will not tell in his favour, to put
the very best face upon what he is compelled to
relate, and to make the most of excellencies. His
opinion, therefore, must be received with caution, for
it is his duty to be partial, in the most odious sense
of that word, and it would be a capital sin to deviate
from this long-established rule.
</p>
<p>
These difficulties do not beset the life that is here
presented to the public. Father Ignatius had his
alternations of praise and blame during life; but
those who thought least of him were forced to admit
his great sanctity. If this latter quality be conceded,
apology has no room. An admitted saint does not
require to be defended; for the <i>aureola</i> of his own
brow will shed the light through which his actions
are to be viewed. We see, therefore, no wrong impressions
that require to be removed&mdash;no calumnies
that have to be cleared away&mdash;nothing, in fact, to be
done, except to give a faithful history of his life.
For this reason, we venture to publish this work
before the second anniversary of his death; and it
would have been published sooner, if the materials
from which it is composed could have been arranged
and digested.
</p>
<p>
Again, he was heedless of the praise or blame of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">{x}</a></span>
men himself, and it would be an injustice to his
memory to wait for a favourable moment for giving
his thoughts publicity.
</p>
<p>
Those who expect to find nothing in the lives of
holy people but goodness and traits of high spirituality,
will be disappointed when they read this.
Those who are accustomed to read that some saints
indeed have lived rather irregularly in their youth,
but find themselves left in blessed ignorance of what
those irregularities were, will also be disappointed.
They shall find here recorded that young Spencer was
not a saint, and they shall be given data whereon to
form their own opinion too. They shall see him pass
through various phases of religious views, and shall
find themselves left to draw their own conclusions
about his conduct throughout.
</p>
<p>
And now, perhaps, it is better to give some reasons
why this course was adopted in writing his life, rather
than the usual one. Besides that already given, there
are two others.
</p>
<p>
In the first place, ordinary, well-meaning Christians
feel disheartened when they find saints ready to be
canonized from their infancy, and cannot think of the
Magdalenes when they find the calendar full of Marys,
and Agneses, and Teresas. Neither will they reflect
much on an Augustin, when the majority are Sebastians
and Aloysiuses. Here is an example to help
these people on; and they are the greater number.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">{xi}</a></span>
We have therefore shown Father Ignatius's weak
points as well as his strong ones; we have brought
him out in his written life precisely as he was in
reality.
</p>
<p>
He comes before us with a mind full of worldly
notions, he traces his own steps away from rectitude,
he makes his confession to the whole world. How
many will see in the youth he passed, far away from
God and grazing the edge of the bottomless precipice,
a perfect illustration of their own youth. Let them
then follow him through life. They shall find him a
prey to the worst passions, anger, pride, and their
kindred tendencies. They shall see him put his hand
to the plough, and, according to the measure of his
grace and light, subduing first one, and then another
of his inclinations. They can trace his passage through
life, and see that he has so far overcome his passions
that an equivocal warmth of temper is a thing to be
wondered at in him. There is a servant of God that
gives us courage, we need not despond when he leads
the way for us. Occasional imperfections are mentioned
towards the latter part of his life. These only
show that he was a man and not an angel, and that a
defect now and again is not at all incompatible with
great holiness.
</p>
<p>
There was a reality about the man that can never
leave the minds of those who knew him. He hated
shams. He would have the brightest consequences of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">{xii}</a></span>
faith realized. He would not have the Gospel laws be
mere matter of sentimental platitudes, but great
realities pervading life and producing their legitimate
effects. He went into them, heart and soul; and the
few points in which he seemed to go this side or that
of the mean of virtue in their observance, we have recorded,
that others may see how he observed them.
Exceptions show the beauty of a rule; and this is the
second reason why we have written as a historian and
not as a panegyrist.
</p>
<p>
And now for an account of the materials from which
the memoir has been compiled. He wrote an account
of his life about the year 1836. He was then on a
bed of sickness from which he scarcely expected to
rise; but we shall give his own reasons for writing
what he has written. The autobiography begins
thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "When a man comes before the world as an author,
  there is much danger of his being actuated by motives
  of which he does not like to acknowledge the influence,
  and people are so naturally disposed to suspect the
  motive to be something different from that which
  ought to be the leading one of all our important
  actions, and especially of those which are possessed
  by our religious actions; namely, the honour of God,
  and our own neighbour's good; that the common
  preface to such works is, to guard the author against
  the imputation of vanity or of self-love, in some one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>
  or other of the contemptible forms in which it rules
  so widely in this poor world of ours. Such introductory
  apologies, on the part of an author, will not, I believe,
  meet with full credit with those who know the world.
  Those who are most obviously the slaves of self-will,
  will, generally, be loudest in their protestations of the
  purity and excellence of their motives; so that my
  advice to those who wish to establish in the minds of
  others a good opinion of their sincerity, would generally
  be, to say nothing about it, and let their conduct
  speak for itself. Yet this is not what I intend to do
  in the commencement of my present work. What I
  have undertaken is, <i>to give to the public</i> a history of
  my own mind. I shall make it my study to recollect
  with accuracy and to state with truth the motives, the
  impressions, and the feelings by which I have been
  guided in the important passages of my past life; and
  therefore there seems to be some peculiar reason,
  from the nature of the work itself, why I should commence
  by stating why I have undertaken it. Yet I
  will not venture to say positively what are my motives.
  I rather shall state, in the sight of God and of my
  brethren, what are the motives which I allow myself
  to entertain in deliberately presenting a history of my
  thoughts <i>to the public</i>. My readers are at liberty to
  judge me in their own way, and suppose that I deceive
  myself in the view I take of my own intentions as much
  or as little as to them shall seem probable. Of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span>
  which, have obliged me to leave my flock to the care of
  others, while my proper business is to be, for a time,
  to recover my health by rest and relaxation. Here
  then is an opportunity for undertaking something in
  the way of writing; and I am about to make what
  I conceive is the most valuable contribution in my
  power to the works already existing for the defence
  of our Holy Faith.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have not the knowledge requisite for producing
  a learned work, nor am I ever likely to acquire it. A
  work of fancy or invention is, perhaps, yet further out of
  my line. I never had any talent for compositions in
  which imagination is required. I hardly ever wrote
  a line of poetry except when obliged to it at school or
  college. But it requires neither learning nor imagination
  to give a simple statement of facts, and there is
  a charm in truth which will give to a composition,
  which bears its stamp, an interest more lively, perhaps,
  than what the beauties of poetry and fiction are employed
  to adorn.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I believe the history of the human mind must
  always be interesting. If the most insignificant of
  men could but be taught to write a correct account
  of what has passed within his soul, in any period of
  his existence, the history would be full of wonders
  and instruction; and if, with God's help, I am able to
  fulfil my present undertaking, and to give a picture of
  my own mind and heart, and recount, with truth and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span>
  perspicuity, the revolutions which have taken place
  within me, I have no doubt the narrative will be
  interesting. The minds and hearts of men are wonderfully
  alike one to another. They are also wonderfully
  various. Read the history of my mind and you
  will find it interesting, as you know a book of travels
  is, through countries which you have visited. You
  will see your own heart represented to you, and be,
  perhaps, pleasingly reminded of the feelings, the
  projects, the disappointments, the weaknesses of
  days gone by. But I have a greater object before
  me than your amusement. I desire your instruction.
  I may, perchance, throw on some passage of your
  history, on some points of the great picture which a
  retrospect of your past life presents to you, a more
  correct light. I may show you where your views of
  things might have often been more true than they
  were at the time, when your steps might have been
  more prudently, more happily taken, and by the consideration
  of mistakes and errors which I have afterwards
  acknowledged, though once blind to them, and
  from which I have recovered through the goodness of
  God, you may be assisted to take some steps forwards
  in the path of truth and happiness.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I do not, however, propose to myself the benefit
  of others only in this composition. The noblest and
  the most useful study of mankind is man; but, certainly,
  this study is in no way so important as when it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span>
  is in the contemplation of ourselves that we follow it
  up. It is a high point of wisdom to know and understand
  other men; but we know nothing that will
  indeed avail us if we know not ourselves. Hence,
  while I am undertaking a history of myself for the
  instruction of others, I purpose, at the same time,
  and in the first place, to gain from my researches
  instruction for myself. In now recollecting and declaring
  the doings of God towards me, and my doings
  towards Him, I most earnestly desire an advancement
  in myself of love and humility; would that it might
  be an advancement in perfection! I began this work
  with fervent prayer that I may be preserved from the
  snares with which it may be accompanied; above all,
  that I may not make it an occasion of vain-glory, and
  so turn what ought to be done for God's service and
  for others' good into an offence of God and my own
  exceeding loss; but that, being delivered from the
  danger, I may find it the occasion of exceeding
  spiritual benefit to myself, if it be not to any
  others."
</p>
<p>
The reader must take what Father Ignatius writes
of himself with some qualifications. He seems to
have had an invincible propensity to put his worst side
out in whatever he wrote about himself. He did not
see his own perfections, he underrated his knowledge,
his mind, his virtues. He saw good in every one
except himself. But it is needless to speak much on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix">{xix}</a></span>
this point, as his candour and simplicity are sure to
make every reader favourable.
</p>
<p>
It is to be regretted that the autobiography does not
reach farther into his life than his ordination as a
minister. How gratifying it would have been if we
could read his interior conflicts, his exterior difficulties,
his alternations of joy and sadness, in the sweet, affectionate
style which tells us his early life. But the
reason must have been:&mdash;He had little to charge
himself with; he had no faults serious enough to
lower him in the esteem of men from that time forward,
and therefore he did not write.
</p>
<p>
The next source of information is his journal. He
began to keep a journal in 1818, when he first went
to Cambridge, and continued it uninterruptedly down
to 1829, a short time before his conversion. We have
found nothing in the shape of a diary among his
papers, from that time until the year 1846, a few
months before he became a Passionist, except a journal
of a tour he made on the Continent in 1844, and that
is given entire in the third book. The journal from
1846, until a few days before his death, is a mere record
of dates and places in which he has been and persons
he spoke to. It is so closely written that it is scarcely
readable by the naked eye, and he gives in one page
the incidents of six months. This journal was of great
use to him. It helped his memory and prevented his
making mistakes in the multitude of scenes through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx">{xx}</a></span>
which, he passed. It is also a valuable contribution to
the annals of our Order.
</p>
<p>
Besides these two sources of information regarding
his life, we have had access to a multitude of letters,
running over the space of upwards of forty years.
He preserved a great many of the important letters
he received; and several of his friends, who preserved
letters received from him as treasures, kindly lent us
their stock for the preparation of this volume. His
Eminence the late Cardinal Wiseman gave us what
letters he possessed, and promised to contribute some
recollections of his friend, but was prevented by death
from fulfilling his promise. Our thanks are due to
their Lordships, the Right Rev. Dr. Ullathorne, the
Right Rev. Dr. Wareing, the Right Rev. Dr. Turner,
the Right Rev. Dr. Grant, the Right Rev. Dr. Amherst,
and to several clergymen and lay persons, for their
kindness in sending us letters and furnishing us with
anecdotes and pleasing recollections of Father Ignatius.
Among the latter we are under special obligations to
Mr. De Lisle and Mr. Monteith. In truth we have
found all the friends of Father Ignatius most willing
to assist us in our undertaking. Nor must we forget
several religious who have helped us in every possible
way. The information gathered from the correspondence
has been the most valuable. His letters were
written to dear friends to whom he laid the very
inmost of his soul open,&mdash;fervent souls, who sympathized
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span>
with his zealous exertions and profited by his
advice in advancing themselves and others in the way
of virtue.
</p>
<p>
The Dowager Lady Lyttelton has kindly furnished
us with dates and accurate information about the
members of the Spencer family, and as she is the
only survivor of the children of John George, Earl
Spencer, we hope the memory of her dear brother
will serve to alleviate the weight of her advancing
years, and prolong them considerably to her children
and grandchildren. We beg to express our sincere
thanks for her ladyship's kindness.
</p>
<p>
A fourth and not a less interesting source of information
has been our own memory. Father Ignatius was
most communicative to his brethren; indeed he might
be said to be transparent. We all knew him so well.
He related the anecdotes that are given in his memoir
to us all; and when each Father and Brother gave in
his contribution, the quantity furnished would have
made a very entertaining life of itself. Their thanks
must be the consciousness of having helped to keep
him yet amongst us as far as was possible.
</p>
<p>
These, then, are the sources from which the following
pages have been compiled. The facts related may
therefore be relied upon as perfectly authentic. We
possess the originals of the matter quoted&mdash;vouchers
for every opinion advanced, and the anecdotes can be
corroborated by half a dozen of witnesses.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span>
</p>
<p>
Seeing that his life had been so diverse, and that
the changes of thought which influenced the early
portion of it were so various, it was thought best to
divide it into four distinct books. The first book takes
him to the threshold of the Anglican ministry; the
second into the fold of the Church; the third into
the Passionist novitiate; and the fourth follows him
to the grave.
</p>
<p>
We shall let the details speak for themselves, and
only remark that there is an identity in the character
as well as in the countenance of a man which underlies
all the phases of opinion through which he may have
passed. It will be seen that, from childhood to old
age, Father Ignatius was remarkable for earnestness
and reverence. Whatever he thought to be his duty
he pursued with indomitable perseverance. He was
not one to cloak over a weak point, or soothe a doubt
with a trumped-up answer. He candidly admitted
every difficulty, and went with unflagging zeal into
clearing it up. This was the key to his conversion.
He had, besides, even in his greatest vagaries, a
reverential spirit with regard to his Creator, which
formed an atmosphere of duty around him, outside
which he could not step without being stung by conscience.
A sting he never deadened. These were
the centripetal and centrifugal forces that kept his
life balanced on an axis that remained steady in the
centre during his every evolution.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span>
</p>
<p>
We have endeavoured to be faithful to his memory.
We have tried, as far as we could, to let himself tell
his life; we have only arranged the materials and
supplied the cement that would keep them together.
Whether the work has suffered in our hands or not is
immaterial to us. We have tried to do our best, and
no one can do more. If any expressions have escaped
us that may appear offensive, we are ready to make
the most ample apology, but not at the sacrifice of a
particle of truth. If, through ignorance or inadvertence,
errors have been committed, we hold ourselves
ready to retract them; and retract, beforehand, anything
that may, in the slightest degree, be injurious,
not to say contrary, to Catholic doctrine, and submit
ourselves unreservedly in this point to the judgment
of ecclesiastical authority.

<h1>LIFE OF FATHER IGNATIUS
OF ST. PAUL, PASSIONIST.</h1>
<br>


<h1>BOOK I.<br>
<i>F. Ignatius, a Young Noble.</i> </h1>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER I. <br>
His Childhood.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Saint Paul gives the general history of
childhood in one sentence: "When I was a
child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a
child, I thought as a child." The thoughts
and ways of children are wonderfully similar;
the mind is not sufficiently developed to give direction to
character, and the peculiar incidents that are sometimes
recorded to prove "the child the father of the man," seem
more the result of chance than deliberation. With all this,
we like to bask our memory in those sunny days: we love
to look at our cradles, at where we made and spoiled our
little castles, and we recall the smallest incidents to mind, as
if to try and fancy we could be children again. This natural
sentiment makes us anxious to know all about the infancy
and childhood of those whose life has an interest for us;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
although knowing that there can be nothing very strange
about it; and even, if there be, that it cannot have much
weight in moulding the character of our hero, and less still
in influencing our own. The childhood of Father Ignatius
forms an exception to this. It is wonderful; it shaped his
character for a great part of his life. Its history is written
by himself, and it is instructive to all who have charge of
children. Before quoting from his own autobiography, it
may be well to say something about his family; more,
because it is customary to do so on occasions like the
present, than to give information about what is already
well known.
</p>
<p>
His father was George John, Earl Spencer, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c.
He was connected by ties of consanguinity and affinity with
the Earl of Sunderland and the renowned Duke of Marlborough;
was successively member of Parliament, one of
the Lords of the Treasury, and succeeded Lord Chatham as
First Lord of the Admiralty on the 20th of December,
1794. This office he retained until 1800, and, during his
administration, the naval history of England shone with
the victories of St. Vincent, Camperdown, and the Nile.
Perhaps his term of office was more glorious to himself from
the moderation and justice with which he quelled the
mutiny at the Nore, than from the fact of his having
published the victories that gave such glory to his country.
He married, in 1781, Lavinia, the daughter of Sir Charles
Bingham, afterwards Earl of Lucan. Five sons and three
daughters were the issue of this marriage. Two of them
died in infancy. The oldest, John Charles, Lord Althorp,
succeeded his father in 1834, and died childless in 1845;
the second, Sarah, is the present Dowager Lady Lyttelton;
the fifth, Robert Cavendish, died unmarried in 1830; the
sixth, Georgiana, was married to Lord George Quin, son to
the Marquis of Headfort, and died in 1823; the seventh,
Frederick, father of the present earl, succeeded his eldest
brother in 1845. The youngest, the Honourable George
Spencer, is the subject of the present biography.
</p>
<p>
He was born on the 21st of December, 1799, at the
Admiralty in London, and baptized according to the rite of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
the Church of England, by the Rev. Charles Norris,
prebendary of Canterbury. Whether he was taken to Althorp,
the family seat in Northamptonshire, to be nursed, before
his father retired from office in 1800, we have no means of
knowing; but, certain it is, that it was there he spent his
childhood until he went to Eton in 1808. We will let himself
give us the history of his mind during this portion of
his existence: the history of his body is that of a nobleman's
child, tended in all things as became his station:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My recollections of the five or six first years of my life
  are very vague,&mdash;more so by far than in the case of other
  persons; and whether I had any notions of religion before
  my six-year-old birthday, I cannot tell. But it was on that
  day, if I am not mistaken, that I was taken aside, as for a
  serious conversation, by my sister's governess, who was a
  Swiss lady, under whose care I passed the years between
  leaving the nursery and being sent to school, and instructed
  by her, for the first time, concerning the existence of God
  and some other great truths of religion. It seems strange
  now that I should have lived so long without acquiring any
  ideas on the subject: my memory may deceive me, but I
  have a most clear recollection of the very room at Althorp
  where I sat with her while she declared to me, as a new
  piece of instruction, for which till then I had not been
  judged old enough, that there was an Almighty Being,
  dwelling in heaven, who had created me and all things, and
  whom I was bound to fear. Till then, I believe, I had not
  the least apprehension of the existence of anything beyond
  the sensible world around me. This declaration, made to
  me as it was with tender seriousness, was, I believe, accompanied
  with gracious expressions, which have never been, in
  all my errors and wanderings, obliterated. To what but
  the grace of God can I ascribe it, that I firmly believed
  from the first moment this truth, of which I was not capable
  of understanding a proof, and that I never since have entertained
  a doubt of it, nor been led, like so many more, to
  universal scepticism; that my faith in the truth of God
  should have been preserved while for so long a time I lived,
  as I afterwards did, wholly without its influence?
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
<p class="cite">
  "I continued, with my brother Frederick, who was twenty
  months older than myself, under the instruction of this
  same governess, till we went to Eton School. I do not
  remember the least difficulty in receiving as true whatever
  I was taught of religion at that time. It never occurred
  to me to think that objections might be made to it, though
  I knew that different religious persuasions existed. I
  remember being told by our governess, and being pleased
  in the idea, that the Church of England was peculiarly
  excellent; but I remember no distinct feelings of opposition
  or aversion to the Catholic religion. Of serious impressions
  I was at that time, I believe, very susceptible; but they
  must have been most transient. I remember, more than
  once, distinctly saying my prayers with fervour; though,
  generally, I suppose, I paid but little attention to them. I
  was sometimes impressed with great fear of the Day of
  Judgment, as I remember once in particular, at hearing a
  French sermon read about it; and, perhaps, I did not
  knowingly offend God, but I could not be said to love God,
  nor heartily to embrace religion, if, as I suppose, my
  ordinary feeling must have corresponded with what I
  remember well crossing my mind when I was about seven
  years old,&mdash;great regret at reflecting on the sin of Adam;
  by which I understood that I could not expect to live for
  ever on the earth. Whatever I thought desirable in the
  world,&mdash;abundance of money, high titles, amusements of all
  sorts, fine dress, and the like,&mdash;as soon and as far as I
  understood anything about them, I loved and longed for;
  nor do I see how it could have been otherwise, as the holy,
  severe maxims of the Gospel truth on these matters were
  not impressed upon me. Why is it that the truth on these
  things is so constantly withheld from children; and, instead
  of being taught by constant, repeated, unremitting lessons
  that the world and all that it has is worth nothing; that,
  if they gain all, but lose their souls, they gain nothing; if
  they lose all and gain their souls, they gain all? Why is it
  that they are to be encouraged to do right by promises of
  pleasure, deterred from evil by worldly fear, and so trained
  up, as it seems, to put a false value on all things? How
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
  easily, as it now appears to me, might my affections in
  those days have been weaned from the world, and made to
  value God alone? But let me not complain, but bless God
  for the care,&mdash;the very unusual care, I believe,&mdash;which was
  taken of me, by which I remained, I may say, ignorant of
  what evil was at an age when many, I fear, become proficients.
  This blessing, however, of being wonderfully
  preserved from the knowledge, and consequently from the
  practice, of vice, was more remarkably manifested in the
  four years of my life succeeding those of which I have been
  now writing."
</p>
<p>
The instilling into young minds religious motives for
their actions was a frequent topic of conversation with
Father Ignatius in his after-life. He was once speaking
with some of our young religious on this subject in general;
one of them remarked how easy it was to act upon holy
motives practically, and instanced his own childhood, when
the thought that God would love or hate him kept him
straight in his actions: this was the simple and perpetually
repeated lesson of his mother, which he afterwards forgot,
but which finally stopped him in a career of ambition, and
made him a religious. The old man's eye glistened as he
heard this, and he sighed deeply. He then observed that it
confirmed his opinion, that parents ought to instruct their
own children, and never commit them to the mercies of a
public school until they were perfectly grounded in the
practice of virtue and piety. The next chapter will show
why he thought thus.

<br>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br>
Four First Years At Eton.
</h2>
<br>
<p class="cite">
  "The 18th of May, 1808, was the important day when
  first I left my father's house. With a noble equipage, my
  father and mother took my brother Frederick and me to the
  house of the Rev. Richard Godley, whom they had chosen
  to be our private tutor at Eton. He lived, with his family,
  at a place called the Wharf, about half a mile from the
  college buildings, which we had to go to for school and
  chapel across the playing-fields. Oh! how interesting are
  my recollections whilst I recall the joys and sorrows of Eton
  days; but I must not expatiate on them, as my own feelings
  would lead me to do with pleasure. What I have to do now
  is to record how the circumstances in which I was then
  placed have contributed to influence my religions principles,
  and formed some links in the chain of events by which I
  have arrived at my present state, so different from all that
  might then have been anticipated. Mr. Godley I consider
  to have been, what I believe my parents likewise
  regarded him, a strictly conscientious and deeply religious
  man; and I must always account it one of the greatest
  blessings for which, under God, I am indebted to their wisdom
  and affection, that I was placed in such hands at so
  critical a time. I do not intend, in all points, to declare
  my approbation of the system which he pursued with us:
  but how can I be too grateful for having been under the
  strict vigilance of one who did, I am convinced, reckon the
  preservation of my innocence, and the salvation of my soul,
  his chief concern with me? I remained with Mr. Godley
  till the Midsummer holidays of 1812. My brother left
  Eton and went to sea in the year 1811.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
<p class="cite">
  "Those who know what our public schools are, will
  reckon it, I believe, almost incredible that I should be four
  years at Eton, and remain, as I did, still almost ignorant
  of what the language of wickedness meant. Mr. Godley's
  yoke I certainly thought at the time to be a heavy one.
  Several times each day we were obliged to go across the
  playing-fields to school, to chapel, or to absence (which was
  the term by which Etonians will yet understand the calling
  over the names of the boys at certain times); so that during
  the daytime, when in health, we could never be more than
  three hours together without appearing with the boys of
  the school. Mr. Godley, however, was inexorable in his
  rule that we should invariably come home immediately
  after each of these occasions: by this we were kept from
  much intercourse with other boys. Most grievous then
  appeared my unhappy lot, in the summer months especially,
  when we had to pass through the playing-fields, crowded
  with cricketers, to whom a lower boy, to fag for them and
  stop their balls, was sure to be an important prize, whose
  wrath we incurred if we dared despise their call, and run
  on our way; whilst, if we were but a few minutes late, the
  yet more terrible sight awaited us of Mr. Godley's angry
  countenance. We had not exemption from one of these
  musters, as most boys had who lived at a distance from the
  school, yet none of them were bound like us to a speedy
  return home. It seemed like an Egyptian bondage, from
  which there was no escape; and doubtless the effect was not
  altogether good upon my character. As might be expected,
  the more we were required to observe rules and customs
  different from others, the more did a certain class of big
  bullies in the school seem to count it their business to
  watch over us, as though they might be our evil geniuses.
  A certain set of faces, consequently, I looked upon with a
  kind of mysterious dread; and I was under a constant
  sense of being as though in an enemy's country, obliged to
  guard against dangers on all sides. Shrinking and skulking
  became my occupation beyond the ordinary lot of little
  schoolboys, and my natural disposition to be cowardly and
  spiritless was perhaps increased. I say <i>perhaps</i>, for other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
  circumstances might have made me worse; for what I was
  in the eyes of the masters of public opinion in the school,
  I really was&mdash;a chicken-hearted creature, what, in Eton
  language, is called a <i>sawney</i>. It may be, that had I been
  from the first in free intercourse among the boys, instead of
  being a good innocent one, I might have been, what I suppose
  must be reckoned one of the worst varieties of public-school
  characters, a mean, dishonourable one. Whatever I
  may have lost from not being trained, from the first of my
  Eton life, in the perfect spirit of the place, could I possibly
  have escaped during that time in any other way the utter
  corruption of my morals, at least the filling of my mind
  with familiar images of all the most foul iniquity? For,
  alas! where is the child from the age of eight till twelve
  who, without one compassionate friend, already strong in
  virtue to countenance and to encourage him, shall maintain
  the profession of modesty and holiness against a persecution
  as inveterate and merciless in its way as that which Lot
  had to bear at Sodom? Was not the angel of God with
  me when He preserved me for so long from all attacks of
  this kind in such a place as Eton was in my time? How
  can I remember Godley but with veneration and gratitude,
  who, though, it may be, not so considerately and wisely as
  might be possible (for who is as wise as he might be?), kept
  me, I might say, almost alone untainted in the midst of so
  much corruption.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Yet, till the last year of my stay with him, I did not
  learn decidedly to love religion. It was still my task and
  not my pleasure. At length, my brother Frederick being
  gone to sea, and two other boys, Mr. Godley's stepsons, who
  were with us under his instructions, being sent to school
  elsewhere, I remained his only pupil, and, I may almost
  say, his chief care and joy. He felt with me and for me in
  the desolation of my little heart, at being parted from my
  first and hitherto inseparable mate, and I became his almost
  constant companion. It is not difficult to gain the confidence
  of a simple child: he spoke almost continually of
  religious subjects, and I learnt to take his view of things.
  I certainly did not begin to lose my pleasure in life. Death
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
  was an idea which still was strange to me; and I did not
  come to an understanding of the great doctrines of Revelation.
  I remember not to have taken much notice of any
  peculiar articles of faith; but still believed implicitly,
  without argument or inquiry, what I was taught. I can
  now hardly give an account of what were the religious ideas
  and impressions which began so greatly to engage my mind,
  except that I took my chief delight in hearing Mr. Godley
  speak about religion, that I had a great abhorrence and
  dread of wickedness, thought with pleasure of my being
  intended to be a clergyman, as I was always told I should
  be, and admired and loved all whom I was taught to look
  upon as religious people. All these simple feelings of piety,
  which were often accompanied with pure delight, were
  greatly increased in a visit of six weeks which I paid, with
  Mr. Godley, to his mother and sisters at Chester. He was
  a Prebendary of that cathedral, and of course had to spend
  some time there every year in residence. Usually, when
  he went from home, from time to time, he was used to get
  one of the other tutors at Eton to hear my brother's and
  my lessons, and to look over our exercises; but in the last
  summer I staid with him, with my father's consent, he took
  me with him. Mr. Godley's sisters, who showed me great
  kindness, like him, I suppose, had no wish concerning me
  than to encourage me in becoming pious and good, and I
  got to read a few pious books which they recommended.
  'The Pilgrim's Progress,' Doddridge's 'Life of Colonel
  Gardiner,' Alleine's 'Alarm,' were some which I remember
  taking great effect upon me; so that when I returned from
  Chester to Eton, though I cannot recall many particulars of
  my feelings, I know that the chief prevailing one was, an
  ardent desire to keep myself untainted at Eton, and to keep
  from all fellowship with the set of boys whom I knew to be
  particularly profane mockers of piety. I bought a book of
  prayers, and during the three weeks that I yet remained
  with this tutor, after our return from Chester, and when
  first I went home to the summer holidays, I took no delight
  like that of being by myself at prayer. Ah! how grievous
  would be the thought if we could but understand how to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
  lament such a calamity as it deserves, of a pious child's
  tender, pure soul denied, made forgetful of all its good, and
  hardened. O God, grant me wisdom to understand the
  magnitude of such an evil, grant me a heart now at length
  to mourn over the devastation and uprooting which it was,
  at this time, Thy holy will to permit, of all those fair flowers
  of grace which Thy hand had planted in my heart; and
  grant me to mourn my fall, that I may now once at last
  recover that simplicity of childlike piety, the feelings of
  which I now recollect, indeed, though faintly, but never
  have since again enjoyed. Oh! God, if a child's love, pure
  through ignorance of sin, is never to be mine again, oh!
  give me at least that depth of penance for which my fall has
  given me such ample matter.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It occurred not to my mind to consider whether the
  new thoughts which occupied my mind, and the books in
  which I took such pleasure, would be approved of at home.
  I took them with me to the holidays. It was judged, as
  was to be expected, by my parents, that Mr. Godley's views
  of religion were not such as they would wish to be instilled
  into me; and it was determined that I should leave his
  house and be placed with one of the public tutors at Eton.
  It is a difficult thing to classify religious Protestants, and
  so I do not here pronounce Mr. Godley and his sisters to
  have been Evangelical, or Calvinistic, nor give them any
  distinctive title. They did not, as far as I remember,
  inculcate upon me any peculiar notions of religion, but they
  certainly were not in the way which is usually called orthodox
  Church of England religion, though indeed it is difficult
  to define exactly what this is. It was likely, or rather
  morally certain, that while with Mr. Godley, I should
  follow his guidance, and take his views; so I was to be
  placed among the other boys, as I imagine with the idea
  likewise, that I should gain in this way more of the advantages
  supposed to belong to the rough discipline of a public
  school. I do not understand how it was that I received the
  intimation of this change with so little sadness. Distant
  evils, as we all know, lose their sting strangely; and, having
  the holidays before me when this change was declared, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
  felt no trouble about it then. It is easy to talk a docile
  child into agreement with any plan made for him by those
  whom he is used to confide in; and so I remember no
  difficulty when my books were taken away, and I had no
  more persons by to bring my former thoughts to remembrance,
  in quietly discontinuing my fervent practices."

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br>
His Two Last Years At Eton.</h2>
<br>
<p class="cite">
  "In the course of September, 1812, I began a new stage of
  my life by entering at the Rev. ***'s, where I was, alas!
  too effectually to be untaught what there might be unsound
  in my religion, by being quickly stripped of it completely.
  The house contained, I think, but about ten or twelve boys
  at the time I went to it, a much smaller number than the
  generality of boarding houses about the school; and, dreadful
  as was its moral condition, it was respectable in comparison
  to others. There is no doubt that it was
  recommended to my parents because its character stood
  high among the rest. The boys were divided into three or
  four messes, as they were called. Each of us had a room to
  himself and a separate little establishment, as the boys had
  allowances to provide breakfast and tea for themselves, and
  we did not meet in common rooms for private study, as in
  some schools. In order to make their means go farther,
  two or three would associate together and make a joint concern;
  and very comfortable some would make themselves.
  But comfort was not what I had now to enjoy.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have adverted already to the system of fagging at our
  public schools. The law is established immemorially at
  Eton that the upper boys, those of the fifth and sixth class,
  have an authority to command those below them. This
  law, though understood and allowed by the masters, is not
  enforced by them. They will interfere to check and punish
  any great abuse of the power of the upper boys; but the
  only power by which the commands of these masters are to
  be enforced is their own hands; so that a boy, though by
  rank in the school a fag, may escape the burdens to be
  imposed if he have but age and strength and spirit to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
  maintain his independence. Each upper boy may impose his
  commands on any number of inferiors he may please at any
  time and in any place, so that an unhappy lower boy is
  never safe. Nothing exempts him from the necessity of
  immediately quitting his own pursuits and waiting on the
  pleasure of an unexpected master, but being under orders
  to attend his tutor, or a certain number of privileged
  excuses in matters about which those potentates condescend
  to consider the feelings of the subalterns, and where public
  opinion would condemn them if they did not&mdash;such as
  being actually fagging for some one else, being engaged to
  play a match at cricket which his absence would spoil. It
  was this sort of out-of-door casual service which alone I had
  to dread as long as I was in Mr. Godley's house. When I
  went to Mr. ***, I had to serve my apprenticeship in
  domestic fagging, which consisted in performing to one or
  more of the fifth or sixth form boys in the house almost all
  the duties of a footman or a waiter at an inn. The burden
  of this kind of servitude of course depended, in the first
  place, on the temper of one's master, and then on the
  comparative number of upper and lower boys in a house.
  During the time I had to fag at Mr. ***'s, but especially
  in the latter part of it, the number of fags was dismally
  small, and sometimes heavy was my yoke.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But it is not this which gives to my recollection of that
  period of my life its peculiar sadness. I might have made
  a merry life in the midst of it, like that of many another
  school-boy, and I was merry sometimes, but I had known
  better things. I had once learnt to hate wickedness, and I
  never could find myself at ease in the midst of it, though I
  had not strength to resist it openly. The first evening that
  I arrived at this new tutor's house, I was cordially received
  to mess with the set of three or four lower boys who were
  there. These were quiet, good-natured boys; but, to be
  one with them, it was soon evident that the sweet practices
  of devotion must be given up, and other rules followed from
  those I knew to be right. I was taken by them on expeditions
  of boyish depredation and pilfering. I had never
  been tempted or invited before to anything like this, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
  it was misery to me, on account of my natural want of
  courage as well as my tender conscience, to join such enterprises.
  Yet I dared not boldly declare my resolution to
  commit no sin, and I made a trial now of that which has
  been so often tried, and what has often led to fatal
  confusion&mdash;to satisfy the world without altogether breaking
  with God. One day we went to pick up walnuts in a park
  near Eton; another day to steal beans or turnips, or the
  like, from fields or gardens; then, more bold, to take ducks
  and chickens from farmyards. It is a common idea that this
  kind of school-boys' theft is not indeed a sin. At Eton it
  certainly was not so considered. A boy who stole money from
  another boy was disgraced, and branded as a wretch almost
  beyond forgiveness, whereas for stealing his school-books, he
  would not be blamed; and for robbing orchards or farmyards
  he would be honoured and extolled, and so much the more if,
  in doing it, one or two or three together had violently
  beaten the farmer's boy, or even himself. But where is the
  reason for this distinction? The Word of God and a simple
  conscience certainly teach no such difference. At any rate,
  I know, to my sorrow, that the beginning of my fall from
  all that was good, was by being led to countenance and
  bear a part, though sorely against my better will, in such
  work as this.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "This was not the worst misery. My ignorance in the
  mysteries of iniquity was soon apparent. However much I
  strove to keep my countenance firm, I could not hear
  immodesties without blushing. I was, on this account, a
  choice object of the fun of some of the boys, who took
  delight in forcing me to hear instructions in iniquity. One
  evening after another, I well remember, the quarters would
  be invaded where I and my companions were established;
  all our little employments would be interrupted, our rooms
  filled with dirt, our beds, perhaps, tossed about, and a noisy
  row kept up for hours, of which sometimes one, and sometimes
  another of our set was the principal butt. I was set
  up as a choice object, of course, on account of my simplicity
  and inexperience in their ways, so that some of the partners
  of these plagues with me would blame me for being so silly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
  as to pretend ignorance of what their foul expressions
  meant; for they could not believe it possible that I should
  really be so simple as not to understand them. I maintained
  for some time a weak conflict in my soul against all
  this flood of evil. For a little time I found one short space
  of comfort through the day, when at length, after an evening
  thus spent, I got to bed, and in secret wept and prayed
  myself to sleep; but the trial was too strong and too often
  repeated. I had no kind friend to speak to.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Mr. Godley still lived at the Wharf, and though he
  seemed to think it right not to press himself upon me, he
  asked me to come and dine when I pleased. Two or three
  times I went to dine with him, and these were my last
  really happy days, when for an hour or two I could give my
  mind liberty to feel at ease, and recollect my former feelings
  in this kindly company. But I could not, I dared not, tell
  him all I was now exposed to, and so I was left to stand my
  ground alone. Had any one then told me that by myself I
  must not hope to resist temptation, and rightly directed me
  how to call on God for help, I have since thought I might
  have stood it; but I had not yet known the force of temptation,
  nor learnt by experience the power of God to support
  the weak. My weakness I now felt by clear experience,
  and after a short conflict,&mdash;for this battle was soon
  gained by the great enemy who was so strong in the field
  against me,&mdash;I remember well the conclusion striking my
  mind, that the work of resistance was useless, and that I
  must give up. Where were you, O my God, might I now
  exclaim, to leave me thus alone and unprotected on such a
  boisterous sea? Ah! my Lord, I have never found fault
  with thy divine appointments in thus permitting me to fall.
  Only I say, as before, give me grace now fully to recover
  what I lost; and I will ever bless thee for allowing me to
  have known so much evil, if it be but that I may warn
  others,
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It might be, perhaps, ten days after my arrival at
  Mr. ***'s, when I gave up all attempt to pray; and I
  think I did not say one word of prayer for the two years
  and more that I afterwards continued there. I remember
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
  once being by, when one of the most rude and hard of my
  tormentors was dressing himself, and, to my surprise, turned
  to me, and, with his usual civility, said some such word as,
  'Now hold your jaw;' and then, down on his knees near
  the bed, and his face between his hands, said his prayers. I
  then saw for a moment to what I had fallen, when even this
  fellow had more religion than unhappy I had retained; but
  I had no grain of strength now left to rise. One would
  think that in the holidays my change would have been discovered;
  for I imagine that I never knelt down even at
  home except in the church. But, alas! little did my family
  suspect what a place was Eton; or, at least, if a suspicion
  comes across parents' minds of what their children are
  exposed to in public schools, they generally persuade themselves
  that this must be endured for a necessary good, which
  is, to make them learn to know the world.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "When I had ceased attempting to maintain my pious
  feelings, the best consolation I had was in the company of
  a few boys of a spirit congenial to what mine was now
  become. All the time that I remained at Eton I never
  learnt to take pleasure in the manly, active games for which
  it is so famous. It is not that I was without some natural
  talent for such things. I have since had my time of most
  ardent attachment to cricket, to tennis, shooting, hunting,
  and all active exercises: but my spirit was bent down at
  Eton; and among the boys who led the way in all manly
  pursuits, I was always shy and miserable, which was partly
  a cause and partly an effect of my being looked down upon
  by them. My pleasure there was in being with a few boys,
  like myself, without spirit for these things, retired apart
  from the sight of others, amusing ourselves with making
  arbours, catching little fishes in the streams; and many were
  the hours I wasted in such childish things when I was
  grown far too old for them.

<p class="cite">
  "Oh! the happiness of a Catholic child, whose inmost
  soul is known to one whom God has charged with his salvation.
  Supposing I had been a Catholic child in such a
  situation&mdash;if such a supposition be possible&mdash;the pious feelings
  with which God inspired me, would have been under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
  the guidance of a tender spiritual Father, who would have
  supplied exactly what I needed when about to fall under
  that sense of unassisted weakness which I have described.
  He would have taught me how to be innocent and firm in
  the midst of all my trials, which would then have tended
  to exalt, instead of suppressing, my character. I would
  have kept my character not only clear in the sight of God,
  but honourable among my fellows, who soon would have
  given up their persecution when they found me steadfast;
  and I might have brought with me in the path of peace and
  justice many whom I followed in the dark ways of sin.
  But it is in vain to calculate on what I might have been
  had I been then a Catholic. God be praised, my losses I
  may yet recover, and perhaps even reap advantages from
  them."

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br>
Private Tuition Under Mr. Blomfield.</h2>
<br>

<p class="cite">
  "Had the public masters of the school been attentive to
  the advancement of the scholars in learning while negligent
  of their morals, and had I been making progress in my
  studies while losing my innocence, I might have continued
  longer in that place; for I did not fall into gross, outward,
  vicious habits, and it is possible that no difference was
  perceived in my behaviour at home. But I suppose my
  father saw a wide difference between the care which
  Mr. Godley bestowed on me and that which boys in the
  public tutors' houses could receive. I know not exactly
  the reasons that led to the change; but, in the Christmas
  holidays at the end of the year 1813, Mr. Blomfield was
  invited to Althorp, and he was pointed out to me as my
  intended future tutor. Many of my readers will know at
  once that he is now [Footnote 1] the Protestant Bishop of London. My
  father had presented him somewhat before this period with
  the rectory of Dunton, in Buckinghamshire, having been
  led to do so by the distinguished character which he heard
  of him from Cambridge for he did not personally know
  him when he offered him this piece of preferment. From
  the time that I made his acquaintance, and received some
  directions from him for private reading at Eton during the
  remaining time of my stay there, I began to take some
  more decided interest than I had yet done in advancing
  myself in literary knowledge.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 1: This was written in 1836. See Preface.
  Dr. Blomfield died in 1857.]
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>

<p class="cite">
  This, as well as my growing
  older and more independent of other boys, and falling in
  with more sensible companions, gave to my mind a more
  satisfactory turn during my last year at Eton. There was
  no return, though, to religion whilst I remained there, nor
  was there likely to be; and so, most blessed was the change
  for me when, before Christmas 1814, I left Mr. ***'s,
  and, after remaining at home for about three months in
  company with my brother Frederick, returned for the first
  time from sea, I went to Mr. Blomfield's in March, 1815.
  I staid there till near the time of my first going to Cambridge,
  which was in the summer of 1817. Simplicity and
  purity of mind, alas! are not regained with the readiness
  with which they are lost: the falling into bad company
  and consenting to it will utterly ruin all innocence. The
  removal of occasions may prevent the growth of evil habits
  and the farther increase of corruption; but this alone will
  not restore that blessed ignorance of evil which was no
  longer mine. My residence with Blomfield was, however,
  the means to me of great good. Here I was confirmed in
  that love for study and knowledge of which I have already
  noticed the commencement. He had himself, as is well
  known, though still young, gained a reputation for classical
  learning among the scholars of England and the Continent;
  and his example and conversations inspired me with desires
  for the like distinctions, to which he gave all possible
  encouragement. This I reckon to have been a considerable
  advantage to my religious welfare; for, although the motive
  I set before me was merely worldly, and the subjects
  which I studied had little of a good and much of a bad
  tendency, as must needs be the case with pagan literature,
  yet, by gaining a habit for study, I was directed in a line
  widely distinct from the most vicious of the society through
  which I was afterwards to pass; and, by being a reading
  man at Cambridge, I was saved from much perversion."
</p>
<p>
We shall be pardoned for interrupting the course of this
interesting narrative, by inserting an anecdote, which shows
how unchanged was his opinion on the merits of pagan
literature. In a conversation with his religious companions,
shortly before he died, he happened to say something about
the discoveries of Cardinal Mai among the Bobbio
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
manuscripts. Some one remarked that it was nothing less than
Vandalism for the old monks to erase one of the classic
authors, and write some crude chronicle or other over it.
"Well," replied Father Ignatius, "I suppose the monks had
as much respect for Virgil and Ovid as the angels have."
</p>
<p>
To resume.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But what was of the chief importance to me at this
  time was, being in a house and with company, where, if
  subjects of religion were not so much put before me as with
  Mr. Godley, and if I was not constantly exhorted and
  encouraged in simple piety, I and my fellow pupils felt that
  no word of immorality would have been anywise tolerated.
  Prayers were daily read in the family, the service of the
  Church was performed with zeal and regularity, the Sunday
  was strictly observed, and a prominent part of our instruction
  was on matters of religion. It was also to me an
  invaluable benefit, that the companion with whom I was
  principally associated, during the chief part of my time at
  Dunton, was one who, like me, after a careful education at
  home, where he had imbibed religious feelings, had gone
  through the corruptions of another public school, but was
  now, like me, happy to find himself in purer air.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "With him I was confirmed at Easter, 1816, by Dr.
  Howley, then Protestant Bishop of London, now Archbishop
  of Canterbury. It was an incalculable blessing to
  me, slave as I was to false shame, and cowardly as I was
  to resist against bold iniquity, that I now had had a period
  granted me, as it were, to breathe and gain a little vigour
  again, before the second cruel and more ruinous devastation
  which my poor heart was shortly to undergo. I prepared
  seriously for my confirmation, and for receiving the Sacrament
  from time to time, and recovered much of my former
  good practices of private devotion. I remember especially
  to have procured once more a manual of prayers, and during
  the last months of my stay at Dunton I spent a long time
  in self-examination by the table of sins in that book, somewhat
  similar to our Catholic preparation for confession.
  But, alas! I could go no further than the preparation.
  Oh! the great enemy of our souls knew well what he was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
  doing in abolishing confession. As before, when I first lost
  my innocence and piety at Eton, confession would, I am
  convinced, have preserved me from that fall; so now that I
  was almost recovering from the fall, if I had had the ear
  of a spiritual father to whom I might with confidence have
  discovered the wounds of my poor soul, he would have
  assisted me utterly to extirpate the remains of those evil
  habits of my heart. He would have shown me what I
  knew so imperfectly, the horrible danger of the state in
  which I had been so near eternal damnation; he would
  have made me feel that holy shame for my sins, which
  would have overcome that false earthly shame by which I
  still was ready to be mastered; and he would, in short, have
  poured in that balm and oil which the ministers of God
  possess, to heal, and strengthen, and comfort me for my
  future trials, so that I might have stood firm against my
  enemies. But it pleased Thee, O my God, that once more,
  by such sad experience, I should have occasion to learn the
  value of that holy discipline of penance, the power and
  admirable virtue of the divine sacraments, with the
  dispensation of which Thou hast now entrusted me, that I may
  be a more wise and tender father to Thy little ones whom
  Thou committest to my care."

<br>
<h2>CHAPTER V.<br>
He Goes To Cambridge.</h2>

<p>
Young Spencer went with Mr. Blomfield to Cambridge in
the spring of 1817, and was entered fellow commoner of
Trinity. He returned, immediately after being matriculated,
to his family, and spent the summer in cricketing and
sea-bathing, in Ryde, Isle of Wight, and hunting or
shooting at Althorp. On Saturday, October 18th, he came
to London with his parents. He and his brother Frederick
went about shopping, to procure their several outfits for
the University and the sea. On the morning of the 21st
October, he set out from his father's house to Holborn, to
catch the seven o'clock fly for Cambridge. This vehicle,
which has been so long superseded by the Eastern Counties
Railway, was filled with passengers before the Spencer
carriage arrived. He then took a post chaise at ten o'clock,
and arrived in Cambridge a little before six in the evening.
All that remained of that day, and the greater part of the
next, was spent in getting his rooms furnished, hiring his
servant, making a few acquaintances, meeting those he
knew before, and the other employments of a freshman. His
tutor in classics was Mr. Evans, who long continued in the
same capacity at Cambridge, and had the reputation of being
a most upright man. For mathematics he had a Mr. Peacock,
who afterwards became Dean of Ely, and restored the cathedral
there. He fell into good hands, seemingly, as far as his
studies were concerned. He does not seem to have been
less fortunate in the choice of his companions. He is very
slow in making friends; one he does not like for being "too
much of the fine gentleman;" another invites him, and he
remarks: "I suppose I must ask him to dinner or something
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
else; but I should not wish to continue acquaintance with
him, for though he is good-natured, he is likely to be
in a bad set." He also goes regularly to visit Mr. Blomfield,
who resided in Hildersham, and advises with him
about his proceedings. He also avoids needless waste of time,
and says in his journal: "They all played whist, in their
turns, but Bridgman and myself; which I am glad I did
not, for I like it so well that I should play at it too much if
I once began." Besides these precautions, and a feeling of
indignation that bursts out now and again when he has to
note a misdemeanour in his associates, he reads seven hours
a day on an average. These conclusions are collected from
the notes of a journal he wrote at the time; they mark a
very auspicious beginning; and, being clear facts, will serve
as a kind of glass through which one may read the following
from his autobiography.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My intentions were now well directed (on entering
  Cambridge). I began well, and for a time did not give way
  to the detestable fashions of the place, and was not much
  ashamed in the presence of the profligate. I was very happy
  likewise. I found myself now for the first time emerged
  from the condition of a boy. I was treated with respect
  and kindness by the tutors and fellows of the college; my
  company was always sought, and I was made much of by
  what was supposed to be the best&mdash;that is, the most well-bred
  and fashionable, set in the University. I had all the
  health and high spirits of my age, and I now enjoyed manly
  amusements, being set free from the cowardly feeling of
  inferiority which I had to oppress me at Eton. My first
  term at Cambridge&mdash;that is, the two months that passed
  before the first Christmas vacation after my going there&mdash;
  was, as I thought, the happiest time I had yet known. I
  find it difficult, however, now to understand that happiness,
  and still more to understand the religious principle which
  had more or less some influence over me, when I remember
  one circumstance which by itself proves my religion to have
  been absolutely nugatory, and which, I remember well, most
  grievously spoiled my happiness. As to my religion, I do
  not remember that at that time I said any private prayer.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
  I suppose I must have discontinued it when I left Mr.
  Blomfield's, or soon after. Yet I had a sort of principle
  which guarded me from joining in the profane contempt of
  God's worship which prevails generally in the College
  chapels at Cambridge, and for a long time from consenting
  to the practice of open immoralities, or even pretending to
  approve them, though almost all the young men whom I
  knew at Cambridge either notoriously followed or at least
  sanctioned them."
</p>
<p>
He alludes to "one circumstance" in the last extract as
being a test of his depth in religious matters, which it will
be interesting to have in his own words. It occurred before
his entering Cambridge; but as it considerably influenced
his feelings during his stay there, it may as well find its
place here.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The circumstance to which I allude was something of
  an affair of honour, as the world blindly calls it, into which
  I got engaged, and which had so important an influence
  upon my religious feelings for about two years that I will
  here particularly relate the circumstances of it. In the last
  summer vacation, before my going to Cambridge, I attended,
  with my father, the Northampton races, in our way from
  the Isle of Wight to visit my brother at his place in
  Nottinghamshire. I had begun, at that time, to be extremely
  fond of dancing, as well as cricket, shooting, and
  the like amusements. At this race ball at Northampton, I
  enjoyed myself to the full; but, unwittingly, laid the
  foundation for sorrow on the next day. Fancying myself a
  sort of leader of the gaiety, in a set which seemed to be the
  most fashionable and smart of the evening, I must needs be
  making up parties for select dances; which proceeding was,
  of course, taken by others as intruding on the liberties of a
  public entertainment; and it happened that, without knowing
  it, I barred out from one quadrille which I helped in
  forming, the sister of a young gentleman of name and fortune
  in the county. I was in the mean time making up
  a party for a match at cricket on the racecourse for the next
  day, and this gentleman was one of my chief helpmates.
  The next day, while busy in collecting our cricketers to go
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
  to the ground, I met him in the street, and he gave me
  the hard cut. I knew not what it meant, and simply
  let it pass; but on the morning after, I was surprised
  at receiving a letter from him to tell me what was my
  offence: it ended with the words (which are deeply enough
  impressed on my memory not yet to be forgotten), 'If
  I did not look upon you as a mere boy, I should call
  you in a more serious manner to account for your rudeness.'
  He then told me where he might be found the following
  day. Without much reflecting on this unpleasant communication,
  I showed it to my father, who was near me,
  with several other gentlemen of the county, when I received
  it. He asked me whether I had meant any rudeness, and
  when I told him I had not, he bid me write an apology, and
  particularly charged me not to notice the concluding taunt.
  He afterwards mentioned it to two others of these gentlemen,
  who both agreed that I had done right in sending such
  an answer. But soon after my mind fell into such a torment
  as I had never yet known. The answer was certainly right
  according to Christian rules, and I suppose the laws of
  honour would not have required more; but, at the time, I
  know not whether it would not be esteemed in his mind
  and that of the friends whom he might consult, to be too
  gentle for a man of courage. A most agonizing dilemma I
  was now in, neither side of which I could endure. On the
  one hand, I could not bear to look on death, and standing
  to be shot at was what nothing but a fit of desperation could
  bring me to. On the other, that awful tyrant, the world,
  now, as it were, put forth his hand and claimed me for his
  own. To lose my character for courage, and be branded as
  a coward, was what I could not anyways endure. I went
  with my father in the carriage to sleep at Loughborough;
  and when, at the inn, I retired from him to my bedroom,
  the tumult of my mind was at its height. I had all but
  determined to set off and go that very night to the place
  assigned me by this gentleman, who by one disdainful
  expression had now mysteriously become, as it appeared, the
  master of my doom; and, renewing the quarrel, take my
  chance of the consequence. But again, I saw this would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
  not save my honour, if it were already compromised. It
  was clear that a change of mind like that would hardly
  satisfy the world, which does not forgive a breach of its
  awful laws on such easy terms. I finally slept off my
  trouble for the present; but my soul remained oppressed
  with a new load, which almost made me weary of my life. I
  remained convinced that I had not reached the standard of
  courage in this affair; and I felt, therefore, that it depended
  on the good-nature of this gentleman whether my character
  should be exposed or not. He did not reply to my letter of
  explanation. Was he satisfied or not? During my first
  term at Cambridge he was expected there, and I was even
  invited to meet him at a wine party, as one who was known
  to be one of his neighbours and friends. I dared not show
  any reluctance to meet him, lest the whole story should be
  known at Cambridge; and if I did meet him, was he again
  to treat me with disdain? If he did, how should I avoid a
  duel? I knew that having anything to do with a duel was
  expulsion by the laws of the University; but if I, coward
  as I was, had not yet made up my mind, as I had, that I
  must run the chance of his shot, if he chose still to resent
  the affront, no wonder, if the spoiling of my prospects in
  life, by expulsion from Cambridge, was not much regarded.
  The present distress was evaded by his not coming, as was
  expected. After this I desired one person who knew him
  as a friend, and to whom alone I had explained my case, to
  write and ask whether my apology had appeared to him
  sufficient. The answer to this was an assurance that the
  thing had been no more thought of; but it was two years
  before I met him in person, and by his courteous manner
  was finally satisfied that all was right between us. I might
  think it impossible that the great question could be overlooked
  by men, what is to become of them in eternity, if I
  had not had the experience of my own feelings in such an
  occasion as this. In that memorable evening at Loughborough,
  I did not indeed altogether overlook the moral
  question&mdash;Is a duel wrong? I had made the most of what
  I had heard said in palliation of it by some moralists; I
  could not find any ground, however, to think it right before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
  God; yet the thought of having, perhaps before the next
  day was past, to answer in the presence of God for having
  thrown away my life in it, was not the consideration which
  deterred me from the rash resolution. Now, how stands
  the world in England on this question? It is clear that a
  Catholic, whether ecclesiastic or layman, has no choice.
  He must either utterly renounce his religion or duelling.
  A maintenance of the abominable practice by which duelling
  is justified would deprive him of communion with the
  Church. But how stand Protestants? The clergy are
  exempted from this law by the world. But how many
  Protestant laymen are there of the rank of gentlemen who
  dare to proclaim that they detest duelling, and that they
  would sooner bear the disgrace of refusing a challenge than
  offend God by accepting it, or run the risk of offending
  God? for I suppose the greater part would try an argument
  to prove that it may be excusable. The clergy generally, I
  believe, reckon it decidedly a wicked worldly law, yet they
  receive laymen to communion without insisting on this
  enormous evil being first abjured. I do not, however, here
  propose a further discussion of the question generally. To
  this law of the world, miserably as it tormented me for a
  time, I believe I am indebted spiritually more than can
  well be understood: at least to the misery which it occasioned
  me. I have heard it related of blessed (now Saint)
  Alphonsus Maria di Liguori that he owed his being led to
  bid adieu to the world and choosing God for the portion of
  his inheritance, to making a blunder in pleading a cause as
  an advocate. Having till that time set his happiness on his
  worldly reputation for talent, he then clearly saw how vain,
  were the promises of the world, and once for all he gave it
  up. I knew not, alas! whither nor how to turn for more
  solid consolation, and thus the spoiling of my happiness,
  which had resulted from a mistake in a ball-room, did not
  teach me to be wise; but it contributed materially, and
  most blessedly, to poison my happiness at this time. Yet, in
  a general way, I went on gaily and pleasantly enough, for
  serious reflections, on whatever subject it might be, had no
  long continuance."

<br>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br>
His First Year in Cambridge.
</h2>
<br>
<p>
What strikes a Catholic as the most singular feature in
Protestant education is the want of special training for the
clergyman. A dozen young men go to the University for a
dozen different purposes, and there is the same rule, the
same studies, the same moral discipline for all. Such, at
least, was the rule in the days of Mr. Spencer's college
life. It seems extraordinary to the Catholic student, who
has to learn Latin and Greek only as subsidiary instruments
to his higher studies; who has to read two years philosophy
and four years theology, and pass severe examinations nine
or ten different times in each, besides a general one in all,
before he can be qualified to receive the priesthood. The
clerical training with us is as different from that through
which young Spencer had to pass as one thing can be from
another.
</p>
<p>
His life for the first year may be very briefly told. He
hears from Mr. Blomfield that he is to attend divinity lectures,
and he forthwith begins. He is advised by a Professor
Monk, afterwards Protestant Bishop of Gloucester,
to stand for a scholarship, and he does so after getting
Blomfield's consent. This makes him study very hard for
some time, and though he did not succeed, the taste he had
acquired by the preparation did not leave him till the end
of the year, when he came out in the first class, having left
his competitors, with one exception, far behind. He also
spends some hours every day in athletic exercises, is very
fond of riding, goes now and again to London and Althorp
to amuse himself with attending the theatres, dining out,
shooting partridge, and playing at Pope Joan. He relaxes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
in his determination to avoid whist, and indulges so far that
he puts a note of exclamation in his journal at having
returned to his chambers one night without having had a
game. This seems to be the regular course of his life at
Cambridge, a course edifying indeed, if compared with the
lives of his companions. He says:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have observed before that the example and conversation
  of Mr. Blomfield, while I remained with him, gave an
  impulse to my mind towards the love of literary pursuits.
  I did not think, however, of exerting myself particularly in
  that way till the end of the first term, when I was persuaded
  by Mr. Monk, the Greek professor, now Protestant
  Bishop of Gloucester, to be a candidate for a university
  scholarship. Dr. Monk was four years senior to Mr.
  Blomfield, and I understood from him that he had been of
  great service to him in the same way, when at college,
  encouraging his exertions and studies. I was told that I
  passed this examination creditably, but I did not stand so
  high among the competitors as to make it desirable that I
  should repeat the attempt afterwards, and the only honours
  that I tried for were confined to Trinity College. I was
  thus stimulated during this time to more than common
  exertions; it gave me a disposition to study which continued
  through my time at Cambridge, and was the only good
  disposition which was encouraged in me. I have reason then
  to remember with gratitude those who helped me in this
  way; though it is a lamentable thing that, being there
  professedly as a student for the church, in what is the proper
  seminary for ecclesiastics of the Church of England, I cannot
  call to mind one word of advice given me by anyone
  among my superiors or companions to guard me against the
  terrible dangers with which I was surrounded of being
  entirely corrupted, or to dispose me towards some little care
  of my spiritual concerns.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My studies I followed with great zeal all the time I was
  at Cambridge; but, as is generally the case there with those
  that aim at places in the public examinations, I managed
  them without proper distribution of time. By running
  through the journal I kept at the time I find that, when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
  first I began to read hard, I have often sat without moving
  from my table and read the clock round, that is, from three
  or four in the afternoon to the same hour the next morning,
  for the sake of doing what was counted an extraordinary
  feat. There is no doubt that reading with regularity a
  smaller number of hours every day would be more available
  for the attainment of learning than these immoderate surfeits
  of study, as one may call them; I only interposed a
  few days of amusement, when hardly any work was done.
  In the long run, such a course as mine could not answer, for
  it was sure to hurt the health and prevent the attainment
  of the real end of all a young man's studies, which is,
  acquiring knowledge to be turned to account in after life.
  Few young men at Oxford or Cambridge, I suppose, have
  wisdom enough to calculate this in advance. The object
  which they aim at is present distinction, and outstripping
  their fellows in the race for college prizes; and, as far as my
  experience goes, a glut of reading, if the health does but
  stand it without breaking down, is the way to make the
  most of one's chance at a public examination.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The time of my being at Cambridge is one so interesting
  to me in the recollection, that I cannot satisfy myself, when
  giving an account of my progress through life, without
  dwelling at some length upon it. My college course was not
  very long. At the time when I was at Cambridge, honorary
  degrees were conferred on the sons of noblemen at the end
  of two years' residence, by which they came to the enjoyment
  of the rank and all the privileges of a Master of Arts,
  which title was not to be attained, in the ordinary course,
  in less than six or seven years. And what shortens the
  college life much more is the extravagant length of the
  vacations; so that what is reckoned one year at Cambridge
  is not more than five months' actual residence in the
  University. Yet this is a most important and critical
  period, and the short two years during which I was an
  undergraduate at Cambridge were of immense importance
  in my destiny. How vast is the good, of which I have
  learned the loss, but which I might have gained, had I then
  known how to direct my views! On the other hand, how
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
  may I bless God for the quantity of evil from which I have
  been preserved, and how wonderful has been my preservation!
  When I remember how destitute I was of religion
  at this time, I must say that I have to wonder rather at my
  being preserved from so much evil, than at my having fallen
  into so much. And how can I bless God for his exceeding
  goodness of which I am now reminded, when I think how,
  against my own perverse will, against my foolish, I must
  say mad wishes, I was prevented by his Providence from
  being at this time irrevocably ruined and lost? What can
  I return to Him for this blessing? One principal intention
  in my present work is to record the sentiments of gratitude,
  however weak and most unworthy, with which I at least
  desire my soul to be inflamed, and which I hope will engage
  all the powers of my soul throughout eternity. Most
  gladly, if it were for His honour and for the edification of
  one soul which by the narrative might reap instruction, I
  would enter before all the world into a more detailed
  explanation of this my wonderful deliverance; but this I
  must not do, for I must not be the means that others,
  hitherto in the simplicity of holy ignorance, should be made
  acquainted with the dark iniquity of which the knowledge
  has once infected my own unhappy understanding. Be this
  enough to say on this point, which I was obliged to touch,
  lest it should seem unreasonable that I should speak of my
  case as one of most marvellous and almost unparalleled mercy,
  when the circumstances which I may now detail, and what
  are generally known among my most intimate companions,
  do not justify such feelings in the review of it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "By the great mercy of God, I had provided for me a
  refuge and, as it were, a breathing time, between Eton and
  Cambridge. At Mr. Blomfield's, my progress in evil was
  checked, and I had time to prepare myself for the University
  with good resolutions, though I knew not what sort of
  trials I should meet with there, nor had I learnt how
  unavailing were my best resolutions to support me, while yet
  I had not wholly put my confidence in God's grace. The
  vacation which came between my leaving Dunton and going
  to Cambridge I spent chiefly in the Isle of Wight, and my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
  soul was almost wholly occupied that summer about cricket.
  I never became a great cricketer myself; I had lost the best
  time for gaining the art while at Eton; but, this summer,
  what perseverance and diligence could do to make up for
  lost time, I think I did. Oh! that I might have the same
  degree of zeal now in serving the Church of God, and
  collecting and instructing a faithful flock, as I then had in
  seeking out, and encouraging and giving and procuring
  instruction for my troop of cricketers. The occupation of my
  mind on this subject was enough to drive away any ardent
  attention to religion as well as to study. I may say, in
  favour of this passion for cricket, that it was one of the
  pursuits which I took to at the recommendation of my
  mother. I remember generally that when anything in the
  way of amusement or serious occupation was suggested to
  me by her, or anything else but my own fancy, nothing
  more was required to make me have a distaste for it.
  Otherwise, how many useful accomplishments might I have
  gained which would now have been available to the great
  objects I have before me. My dear mother wished me to
  learn fencing when I was at Eton, and a good deal of time
  I spent, and a good deal of money must have been paid by
  my father to Mr. Angelo, the fencing-master who came to
  Eton. It might have been better for me to have gained
  perfection in this exercise, by which it is related that St.
  Francis of Sales acquired in part that elegance of manner
  and nobleness of carriage through which he gained so many
  souls to Christ. While other boys made fencing their
  amusement, I always would have it as a task, and of
  course gained nothing by it. At a later period, when we
  were at Naples, and I had a weakness in my eyes which
  made such an employment suitable, my mother would have
  had me learn music. She gave me a guitar, and would
  have paid for my lessons; but I could not take to it, and
  have thus lost the advantage which, since I have become a
  Catholic, I should have so much valued of understanding
  the science of music, seeing that the trifling knowledge I do
  possess is of so much use. There is the apology, then, for
  my cricket mania; that she proposed my taking to it in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
  summer I speak of. I was surprised to find myself willing
  to acquiesce in the suggestion. What I did take to I generally
  followed excessively, and she did not calculate on the
  violence with which I followed up this. I got into very
  little bad company by means of this pursuit, and perhaps,
  on the whole, I rather gained than lost by it. It was manly
  and healthful, and though, when in the heat of it, I thought
  it almost impossible I should ever give it up, yet when I
  took Orders I did give it up; and if it was in itself of no
  use, I hope that one sacrifice, among the many I was
  obliged to make and, thank God, did willingly make to
  more important objects, it was not without value. Thus
  much for my cricketing; I mention it here as being the
  only distinct cause to which I can attribute my losing before
  I went to Cambridge the habits of serious thought and of
  regular prayer, which I have observed I regained in a good
  degree towards the latter part of my Dunton time.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I nevertheless was full of good purposes. I desired
  and was resolved to keep myself from giving countenance
  to immorality as well as practising it, though after having
  once given way at Eton, I hardly ever dared to say a word
  or even to give a look in disapproval of whatever might be
  said or done before me by bold profligates. I could not
  bear to appear out of the fashion; so that when other boys
  at Eton used to talk of the balls and gay parties which
  they had been to in their holidays, I was quite ashamed,
  when asked what I had done, to say that I had been to no
  balls; for to my mother I am greatly indebted for her wise
  conduct in this respect, that she did not, as was done by
  others, make us men before our time. So, although I detested
  and from my heart condemned the fashionable immoralities
  of the young men with whom I came to be
  associated about the time of my going to Cambridge, I
  hardly dared declare my mind, except sometimes, almost
  in confidence, to one who seemed to be like myself. Oh!
  what good might I have done had I then known the value
  of God's grace, and, despising the world, boldly stood up for
  the cause of virtue, at the same time continuing to be gay
  and cheerful with my companions, and taking a leading part
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
  in all innocent and manly diversions, and in the objects of
  honourable emulation which were set before me and my fellows.
  I know how much I might have done by supporting
  others, weak like myself, by acting at this time as I ought
  to have done, by what I felt myself on one or two occasions
  when such support was given me. I thank God that the memory
  of my brother Robert, who died in 1830, commanding
  the <i>Madagascar</i>, near Alexandria, now rises before me to
  claim my grateful acknowledgment as having twice given me
  such help at a critical time. Never was a man more calculated
  than he to get on, as it is said, in the world. He was brave and
  enterprising, and skilled in all that might make him distinguished
  in his profession; at the same time he was most
  eager in the pursuit of field sports and manly amusements;
  and in society was one of the most agreeable and popular
  men of his day. Once I remember complaining to him
  that I was ashamed of having nothing to say before some
  ladies about balls, when I was about sixteen. 'What a
  wretched false shame is that!' said he to me. From that
  time I became more ashamed of my shame than I had been
  before of my want of fashion. More important yet was
  the service he did me when he was about to go on one of
  his cruises as commander of the <i>Ganymede</i>. I was talking
  with him, the last evening before he left London, about the
  Easter before I went to Cambridge. He knew well what I
  should be exposed to better than I did and charged me
  to take care never to laugh or look pleased when I was
  forced to hear immoral conversation. What rare advice
  was this from the mouth of a gay, gallant young officer;
  and if there were more of his character who were not
  ashamed to give it to their young brothers and friends, how
  many might be saved, who are now lost, because they do not
  see one example to show how a manly, fashionable character
  can be maintained with strict morality and modesty.
  These few words from him were of infinite service to me.
  They made deep impression on me at the time I heard
  them, and the resolution which I then made continued
  with me till after I had been some time at Cambridge,
  when the battle I had to bear against the universal fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
  of iniquity once more, as formerly, at Eton, proved too
  strong for me, and I again gave way. My fall now was
  gradual. I began with the resolution to avoid all expenses
  which would embarrass me with debts, and to keep from
  several fashionable amusements which would engage too
  much time. For awhile, on this account, I would not
  play at cards; but in less than half-a-year this determination
  failed, and I wasted many an evening at whist of my
  short college life. I soon grew careless, too, about my
  expenses, and should have been involved in great embarrassments,
  had it not been for my brother's (Lord Althorp's)
  generosity, who, hearing from me at the end of my first
  year that I was in debt, gave me more than enough to clear
  it all away; and, thus having enabled me to set my affairs
  again in order, was the means of saving me from ever
  afterwards going beyond my means extravagantly. I might,
  however, have given way in some such resolutions as not
  playing at cards; I might have entered into some expenses
  which I shunned at first, without losing my peace of mind,
  and again defiling my conscience, of which the good condition
  was partly restored; but these were not the crying
  evils of the place. In the set with which I was now associated
  in the University, gambling was not at that time
  much practised, and not at all insisted on. There were
  occasional drunken parties, and it was with difficulty that I
  kept out of them; but the system of violently forcing
  people to drink, as well at the Universities as throughout
  genteel society in England, had fallen off before my time.
  There were some sets where drinking was practised at
  Cambridge much more excessively than in what called
  itself the best set of all. I could not help, without
  offending the laws of society, being present at a
  considerable number of dinners and suppers where men
  drank immoderately, but I was permitted to keep myself
  sober without much difficulty; one or two gave me countenance
  thus far, though any intimation of disapproving
  of what others did, on religious or moral grounds, I felt
  would not have been anyways tolerated; and so I ventured
  not. Swearing was among them rather unfashionable than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
  not. Some undergraduates were notorious for profane and
  impious language; and this was excused, and tolerated, and
  made fun of, but it was not common, and many among us
  made no difficulty of condemning it. I therefore never fell
  into this habit. The crying, universal, and most frightful
  evil of the place was open immorality. There was at
  Cambridge, in my time, a religious set, who were sometimes
  called Simeonites, from Mr. Simeon, one of the great leaders
  and promoters of the Evangelical party in these latter days,
  who was minister of one of the small churches in Cambridge,
  and for many years attracted into his influence a
  certain number of young men. Among these open vice was
  not countenanced; but not so the set to which I principally
  belonged, and these were as distinct as if they had not
  belonged to the same University. I was introduced to
  some few of these, and rather valued myself on having an
  acquaintance with them, as well as with many of the purely
  reading men; and my fashionable friends did not altogether
  object to it, though I was generally a little ashamed at being
  seen with any of them, and avoided any frequent intercourse
  with them. I have wondered since that, if it were only
  from mere curiosity, I should never once have gone to hear
  Simeon preach, but so it was. I understood nothing whatever
  of what is in England called Evangelical religion.
  Indeed, I thought nothing of religion; had I paid any
  attention to it at this time, I could hardly have escaped
  seeing how desperate was the course which I was following,
  and I might perhaps have taken a strong resolution, and
  have joined the serious party at once; but, very likely, I
  should have found the power of fashion at that time too
  great, and, by knowing more of religion, should only have
  made my conscience more guilty; and so I believe it may
  be better that none ever spoke to me on the subject all the
  time. I repeat it, that in our set, whatever other deviation
  from the most established fashion was tolerated, any maintenance
  of chastity or modesty was altogether proscribed.
  It was not long, then, before I found myself beat out of the
  position I endeavoured to maintain. During the first term
  I stood my ground rather better. One reason for this was,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
  that among what were called the freshmen&mdash;that is, those
  who entered with me on my college life, there were several
  who were not initiated in vicious practices. These, remaining
  for a time more or less in their simplicity, gave me some
  countenance in not going at once in the way of the veteran
  professors of evil. But as I saw some of them grow by
  degrees shameless and bold, and soon beginning to join their
  older brethren in upbraiding my weakness and folly for not
  being like the rest, I found all my resolution failing, and,
  alas! many a deliberation did I take whether I should not
  at length enter the same way with them. I was still withheld,
  though it was not the fear of God which restrained
  me. I knew that my entering a course of open profligacy
  would not be tolerated by my parents. I had a character
  for steadiness among the tutors and fellows of the college,
  which I was ashamed to lose; though even before them I
  found it sometimes to answer best not to appear different
  from other young men. Besides, as I had resisted the first
  period of attacks, and established among my companions a
  kind of character of my own, I felt that even they would
  be astonished if I at last declared myself as one of their
  sort. I could not bear the thought of their triumph, and
  the horrid congratulations with which I should be greeted,
  if once I was found going along with them in open feats of
  iniquity. Oh! how grievous is the reflection that by such
  motives as these I was restrained. I was longing often to
  be like them. I could not bear the taunts which were
  sometimes made at me. Here again some of the old
  Etonians perhaps would bring up the remembrance of my
  ancient propensity to blush, and would take pleasure in
  putting me again to confusion. Occasionally, by strange
  interpositions of Divine Providence, I was hindered from
  accomplishing purposes of evil which I had, in a sort of
  desperation, resolved by myself to perpetrate, by way of
  being decided one way or other, like a man on the
  brink of a precipice determining to throw himself down in
  order to escape the uneasy apprehension of his danger. One
  way or another I was restrained, so that it has afterwards
  appeared to me as if I had but barely stopped short of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
  taking the last decisive steps by which I might be irrevocably
  ranked among the reprobate. I never thought at the
  time of this danger, otherwise I could hardly have borne
  my existence; but, as it was, my mind at times was gloomy
  and miserable in the extreme. To make me yet more so,
  at the end of my first year I began to be afflicted with
  bilious attacks, arising, perhaps, from my imprudent management
  in regard to study, to diet, and to hours; and
  these occasioned exceeding depression of spirits, under which
  I used to fancy myself the most unhappy of creatures. I
  had no knowledge of the power of religion to set me free,
  and make me superior to all external sensible causes of
  depression, and I knew no better than to give myself up to
  my low feelings when they came upon me, till some distraction
  removed them, or till the fit passed away of itself.
  Many times at Cambridge, in order to hold up my head in
  a noisy company after dinner, I drank wine to raise my
  spirits, though not to great excess, yet enough to teach me
  by experience how mistaken is the calculation of those who,
  when in sorrow, seek to cheer themselves in that way, or in
  any way but by having recourse to God by prayer and acts
  of resignation. I remember well once being told by a good
  aunt of mine, that it was quite wrong to give way to my
  depression, about which I one day complained to her, and
  that religion would surely cure it; but the time was not
  come for me to understand this truth, and I took no notice
  of her words.

<p class="cite">
  "In the meantime I continued zealous about my studies.
  I did not stop to ask <i>cui bono</i> was I working in them. Had
  I seen how utterly vain was a first-class place or a Trinity
  prize-book, which I had set before me as the object of my
  labours, I should have found but little consolation and
  refreshment to my melancholy reflections in these pursuits.
  On the contrary, I should only have pined away with a more
  complete sense of the truth of the Wise man's sentence
  which Almighty God was teaching me in His own way, and
  in His own good time: '<i>Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity</i>'
  but to serve Thee only. I do not mean that if rightly followed,
  such academical honours are worth nothing. I wish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
  I had followed them more prudently and effectually. They
  were the objects set before me by my superiors at the time,
  and I should say to another in my place that he should do
  his best to gain the highest place in a spirit of obedience,
  and for the honour of God, to whom we owe all the credit
  and influence in the world which, by just and honourable
  exertions, we can gain. In recollecting, therefore, how I
  exerted myself, and succeeded in these attempts, I am
  dwelling on one of the most happy points of view which
  that part of my life suggests to me; for though I did not
  do this <i>as</i> I ought, yet I was doing <i>what</i> I ought, and by
  doing so was preserved from much evil, and God knows
  how far the creditable footing I gained at Cambridge in the
  studies of the place may yet be available for a good end."
</p>
<p>
It is hard to believe young Spencer was so utterly devoid
of religion as he here describes himself to be; we draw a
more favourable inference from a journal he kept at the time.
Noticing the death of the Princess Charlotte, he says: "It
appears to be the greatest calamity that could have befallen
us in public, and it is a deplorable event in a private point
of view. It must be ascribed to the interposition of Providence,
which must have some end in view beyond our
comprehension." He speaks of the death of Mrs. Blomfield
thus&mdash;"It is for her a happy event, after a life so well
spent as hers has been." A few pages further on he has
these words about the death of another friend of his. "I
was extremely shocked to-day at hearing that James Hornby
died last Friday of apoplexy. It was but a short time past
that I was corresponding with him about the death of Mrs.
Blomfield; and little he or I thought that he would be the
next to go. The last year and a half I stayed at Eton I
lived in the greatest intimacy with him, which had afterwards
fallen away a little; but he was very clever and
promising, and I always was fond of him. It must be
a wise dispensation of Providence, and may be intended as
a warning to us, in addition to those we have lately had in
the deaths of Maitland and Dundas. God grant it may be
an effectual one!"
</p>
<p>
These are not the spontaneous expressions of one altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
a stranger to piety, though they may very well be
put down as the transient vibration of chords that had long
lain still in his heart, and which these rude shocks must
have touched and made audibly heard once more. This
conclusion is more in accordance with other remarks found
scattered here and there in the same journal. He criticises
sermons and seems to like none; he is regular at chapel and
puts on his surplice on the days appointed; but he refuses
to take the sacrament for no conceivable reason but that he
does not care about it, and hears it is administered unbecomingly.
He is shrewd and considerate in his remarks
upon persons and things; yet there is scarcely a line of
scandal or uncharitableness in the whole closely written
volume. When he records a drunken fit or a row, he suppresses
the names of the rioters; and if he says a sharp word
about a person in one page, he makes ample amends for it in
many pages afterwards; by showing how mistaken he was at
first, and how agreeable it was to him to change his opinion
upon a longer acquaintance. This might not appear very
high praise; but let us take notice of his age and circumstances,
and then perhaps it may have its value. He was a
young man, just turned eighteen; he had been brought up
in splendour at home, and in a poisonous atmosphere at school.
That he was not the vilest of the vile is to be wondered
at more than that he preserved as much goodness as he did.
Where is the young man, of even excellent training, who
will be able to contend, unaided and taunted, against a whole
college of the finest youth of any country? His motives
may be beneath a Christian's standard, but the fact that
with this weak armour, the bare shadow of what it might
be, he made such noble resistance and passed almost
unscathed through the furnace into which he was cast, only
shows what he would have done had he been imbued with
the teachings of a higher order. The very human respect
and worldly considerations that succeeded in keeping him
from vice, acquire a respectability and a status in the catalogue
of preservatives from the fact of their being successful
in his case. His was a fine mind, and one is moved to
tears at seeing this noble material for sanctity thus tossed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
about and buffeted by a herd of capricious companions who
could not see its beauty. Let us take up any young man's
journal of his age and read some pages of it, what shall we
find? Jokes played upon green freshmen, tricks for outdoing
proctors, records of follies, or perchance pompous
unreality put on to conceal all these or worse. His diary is
the generous utterance of a noble mind; it is candid, true,
conscientious, and puts a failing and a perfection of the
writer side by side. It is no wonder that he was loved and
courted, and that his companions had acquired an esteem for
him in college, which years and toils have not succeeded in
lessening. His keen grief at the deficiencies of his college
life only shows to what height of sanctity he had reached,
when what another might boast of wrung from him these
lamentations.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br>
Conclusion Of His First Year In Cambridge.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The events recorded in his journal at this time could very
conveniently be swelled into chapters, if one had a mind to
be diffuse. To trace the fortunes of the gentlemen he
comes in contact with&mdash;Denison, Wodehouse, Carlisle,
Hildyard, Brougham, and a host of others, who afterwards
shone in different circles, High Church controversies,
pleadings at the bar, parliamentary debates, and Irish
Lord-lieutenancies,&mdash;would form some very interesting episodes.
We should add many titles to the off-handed
surnames of the collegian's journal, and say a few words
about how those dignities were procured, earned, and
worn by the possessors. It might be, perhaps, interesting
to some readers to know how many gay young noblemen
were enticed into becoming sons-in-law to some very
reverend doctors. All this and more Mr. Spencer notes
down in the journal, but it is not our theme.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have before observed that about my first Christmas
  I was encouraged by Mr. Monk and by Mr. Blomfield, who
  had removed from Dunton and lived then about ten miles
  from Cambridge, to undertake a contest for a University
  prize; but from this I afterwards drew back. I followed
  up then principally the object of getting into the first class
  at the Trinity College examinations, which took place at
  the end of each year, and which is an honour much
  esteemed, on account of that College standing so high in
  the University, though of course it is not on a level with
  the honours gained in examinations where competitors are
  admitted from the whole body of students in the University.
  It was one object of silly ambition at Cambridge to
  do well in the examinations without having appeared to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
  take much trouble about it. During my second term I fell
  into the idea of aiming a little at this, and I went to many
  more parties, and took more time for various amusements,
  particularly cards, than I allowed myself in the first term.
  Had I not been checked for this, I should probably have
  lost much ground in my race. But a check did come to me
  at Easter, when I went to town, and one evening expressed
  to my father and mother something of self-congratulation
  for having united so much amusement with my studies.
  My mother saw the danger I was now falling into, and, as
  it seemed to me, with too great severity, for an hour
  together represented to me the absurdity of my notions, and
  upbraided me with going the way to disappoint all their
  prospects. I had no thought of bringing such a reproof
  upon myself, and went to bed actually crying with mortification.
  However, it had its effect, and I was thankful for
  it afterwards. The next term, which was the last and
  critical one before the examination, I spent in very severe
  and regular study, and cared not how some idle ones
  might derogate from my success, and comfort themselves
  for their inferiority by the thought, that I had read so hard
  as to take away from my merit. At length, on the 18th
  May, 1818, the very day, as I observed, on which, ten
  years before, I had gone to Eton, I went into the examinations
  in which was to be gained the little share of credit
  in this way which was to fall to my lot. They lasted for a
  week; and, a day or two after, I received a note from
  Mr. Amos, now a distinguished ...... in London, who
  was one of the examiners, and a great friend of mine,
  which filled me with exultation: 'I have the greatest
  pleasure in informing you that you are in the first class.
  Ollivant is only eight marks above you, and you and he
  have left all the rest of the class at a long, very long,
  distance.' I afterwards learnt that the highest number of the
  marks was between 1,600 and 1,700, and that while
  Ollivant and I were near together at the head, the next to
  me was at the distance of 291. Lord Graham, now Duke
  of Montrose, was one of the first class, and if he had read as
  much as I did, there is no doubt he would have been before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
  me. I was told at the same time that I learnt the above-named
  particulars, as I find it in my journal, that 'I was
  best in mathematics, and Grahame next, although Grahame
  was first in algebra;' after which I thus expressed my
  ambition at the time: 'I hope that Grahame will not read
  for next year's examination, and if my eyes last out (for at
  that time I was under some apprehension on that point) I
  may have a chance of being first then, which would be
  delightful.' Such is all earthly ambition, and, as in my
  case, so always its effects&mdash;disappointment and mortification.
  Had I offered all my studies to God, and worked for Him,
  depending on His help, I should have done much more.
  I should have enjoyed my successes more purely, and should
  have been guarded from all disappointment. The second
  year's examination is much more confined to mathematics
  than to classics, and had I been wise and regular and
  well-disciplined in my mind, I might have gained that <i>first</i>
  place which I was aiming at, for Grahame did not read for
  it. As it was, Ollivant, who was some way behind me in
  the first year, got up his ground, and beat me in the second
  year's examination, in which, though I was second again,
  I had no remarkable superiority over the one who came
  next to me."
</p>
<p>
Spencer formed the acquaintance of Sir Thomas Fremantle
while they were both at Dunton under the charge of Mr.
Blomfield. Fremantle went to Oxford and he to Cambridge,
but they continued the intimacy, begun here, to which
Spencer pays cordial tributes of unfeigned gratitude. Sir
Thomas was a welcome guest at Althorp; he and George
used to spur each other on to renewed exertions in the pursuit
of literary honours. Spencer formed a plan for the long
vacation, and went, on March 25, to Oxford, to lay the subject
before Fremantle; it was, that they should go somewhere
and read together. Spencer got into the coach in
London, and arrived in Oxford at twelve at night. He
lionised the place next day, was introduced to different celebrities,
and dined and "wined" in the most select companies
his friends, Fremantle and Lord Wilton, could muster for his
reception. He lived during the time in the rooms of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
fellow commoner of Oriel. He did not leave a single
department unvisited. He played at tennis with a Mr.
Denison; compared the agreements and disagreements of
their ways there with those of Cambridge; the only thing
noteworthy he chose to put down in his diary, as the result
of his comparison, is, that (when he plays cards in W ***'s
rooms, where there are four tables) "they play high, and I
do not like the kind of party so well as those at Cambridge."
</p>
<p>
Spencer continued in Cambridge, and read, or idled,
as the tone of his mind directed, until the 31st of July,
1818. This morning he set off, at half-past five, in the
<i>Rising Sun</i>, for Birmingham; he falls in with a brilliant
Etonian, who recounts the progress of things at his old
school; and has to sleep in what he calls "the most uncomfortable
and uncivil inn I have ever seen." He sets off on
another coach next morning for Shrewsbury, and finds, to
his agreeable surprise, that Fremantle travelled by the inside
of the same vehicle. They both travel together into Wales,
having first procured a supply of candles, tea, and other
commodities for housekeeping, which they did not hope to
find at hand where they were going to. After many long
stages, up-hill and down-hill, among Welsh mountains, and
strange fellow-travellers, they arrive at Towyn, at ten o'clock
at night on the 2nd of August, having been nearly three
days performing a journey which can now be accomplished
in a few hours.
</p>
<p>
Towyn is a little town in Merionethshire, situated on the
sea coast, on a neck of land formed by a graceful little creek,
into which the River Doluny empties itself, and a kind of
sloping arm of the channel. Here Spencer and Fremantle
took up their residence for the long vacation, in a nice little
house for which they paid ten guineas a month. They had
the whole premises to themselves, with a waiting-man named
Davis, and a maid Kitty. Their mode of life was very
regular. They rose early, bathed in the sea, which rolled its
waves against their premises, breakfasted, and studied till two
o'clock. It was customary with them then to go out exploring
with dog and gun until dinner, dine at five, take another
stroll, and read again until they thought it time to take tea,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
and chat until bed-time. Each in turn was steward for a
week; they purchased their own provisions in the little town,
thus making a regular home there for the term of their stay.
They read pretty well for the first week or two; afterwards
they got so fond of brisk air and the adventures they came
across in their daily walks, that the reading became less
agreeable, and soon irksome. The first adventure recorded
in the journal is the following. They were both returning
home after a two hours' vain pursuit of game, and came
across a gouty old gentleman, who asked them a number of
impertinent questions. He then asked them to dine, but
finding out on inquiry that he was "a notorious blackguard,"
although great in lands and money, they politely declined
his invitation. Another time they rode a great way up the
country and stopped at a pretty place, which they found, to
their chagrin, not to be a fairy castle exactly, but "a grand
shop for gossip, kept by two old ladies, assisted by a third,"
at whose qualifications in point of age the reader is left to
make guesses. Another day they went out to shoot, and
met another serious adventure, which is thus noted: "I got
an immense ducking in a black mud ditch, which came up
to my middle or higher, and Fremantle got a wetting too,
but not so serious as mine." Things go on smoothly now
for about a week; they receive several visits from neighbouring
gentry, and the way in which the return to some of
them is described gives us a fair specimen of the flow of
spirits Spencer enjoyed at the time.
</p>
<p class="cite">
<span class="quotehead">"Saturday, Aug. 15.&mdash;</span>
We made ourselves greater bucks than usual to-day, and set
off at two to call on Mr. Scott, near Aberdovey. He takes
pupils there. We came home to dinner at half-past five;
and after dinner (still greater bucks) we went to drink tea
at Bodalog, with Mr. and Mrs. Jeffreys, and came home at
half-past ten (14 miles walking)."
</p>
<p>
The next adventure was
one in which they tried their hands at shooting on the river
with Mr. Jeffreys' long gun; whether the weight of the instrument,
or an effort to reach the game that it killed, drew them
nearer the water than they intended, he tells us that they
"got quite soused in the water," and figured at the gentleman's
dinner-table in two complete sets of the apparel of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
the old man, to the no small amusement of the company.
Nothing remarkable occurred after this to the two friends,
except a trip to Aberystwyth, where they lodged a few days,
met a few old acquaintances, and enjoyed a ball that was
given to the ladies and gentlemen who were there for the
season; until the 14th of September. This day they had a
great battle of words with their landlord, who did not like
their leaving him so soon: in this, however, they came off
victorious. They both travel through Wales, visit Snowdon,
Carnarvon, and meet a body of Cambridge men reading with
a tutor at Conway.
</p>
<p>
September 29th, he took the mail to London, and thus
ended his long vacation. He stays at Wimbledon with his
own family until the time for returning to Cambridge again.
He relates in the journal that a man comes to teach Lady
Spencer, his mother, how to bind books. This may be
thought a strange kind of recreation for a lady of high rank;
but it will not when we read that "this was the same person
who set off the fashion of <i>shoemaking</i>!"
</p>
<p>
He concludes his first year in Cambridge thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
"This day's journal completes a year from the time I began to
keep my history. It has indeed been an important year
in my life the first in which I have been my own master,
and have, I fear, settled my character with all its faults.
Several things which I have both done and undone I shall
never cease regretting. I have only to <i>thank God</i> that there
is no more reason for regret. With my reading, on the
whole, I am as well satisfied as I ever expected."
</p>
<p>
Two
words are underlined in this extract; they were often on
his lips till the day of his death, and frequently formed the
subject of his sermons. If his character had its faults settled
with it in his own estimation, it is pleasing to see the habit
of resignation existing as a virtue in him even at this age.
It was one that was confirmed in him afterwards, to an
eminent degree.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
<br>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
Second Year In Cambridge&mdash;Takes His Degree.</h2>
<br>
<p>
During the first term of his second year in Cambridge, his
average hours of reading decreased; yet he had still a taste
for study, and had not yet thrown aside what remained of his
former ambition to distinguish himself. He and the Duke
of Montrose declaim on the respective merits of Charles V.
and Francis I.; they tossed up for sides, and Charles V.
fell to Spencer. This keeps him at hard study for some
time; meanwhile he hears Ollivant declaim, and thinks he
will get both prizes. After the declamation, in which he
comes off more creditably than he expected, he has half a
hope of a prize, which he says he should be surprised though
delighted to receive. He did get one, but not so high as he
expected. Here and there in his journal at this time a few
expressions of discontent escape from him about Cambridge;
the cause being partially what has been related in the chapter
before last. This had also, conjointly with another circumstance,
the effect of cutting short his University career. He
writes in the autobiography:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I made some good progress during this year, but I
  should have done much more had I been constantly regular.
  I must have suffered great loss by my interruptions, as I
  find by my journal that for about four weeks at the end of
  the long vacation, when I had come home and was taken up
  with shooting, I did not make one hour's study; and two
  more long intervals of cessation from reading took place in
  the Christmas and Easter vacations, when a little steady
  application, if it were but for three hours a-day, would have
  kept my mind attentive, and given me a great advantage.
  After my first examination, I entertained some thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
  of waiving my privilege of taking an honorary degree, and
  going through the Senate House examinations with a view
  to University honours; but I lost all wish to remain at
  Cambridge towards the end of the second autumn. I was at
  times quite disgusted with the place, for such reasons as I
  have stated; besides which, my father and mother had made
  a plan, which pleased me greatly, of going for a year on the
  Continent, in which I was to accompany them. My brother
  Frederick, who was come home about this time, was to be
  of the party likewise, and happy was I in the prospect of
  being again some time in his company; but as an opportunity
  occurred for him to go to South America, with Sir
  Thomas Hardy, with the hope of being made Commander,
  this professional advantage was justly preferred."
</p>
<p>
Some of the heads at Cambridge as well as Lady Spencer
urged him at this time to stand for a fellowship, but he
gave up the idea, and it ended in his joining a new club they
had formed&mdash;the Eton club. These clubs at the Universities
are looked upon with no great favour by proctors and others
who have charge of the morals of the students. Their dinners
entail great expenses on the members, and they end as the
first meeting did in his case: "They all made an enormous
row, and I too, by the bye." He came to spend the
Christmas of 1818 at Althorp, and closes the year with a
succession of parties, Pope Joan, and bookbinding. There
is one little incident recorded in his journal at this time
which gives us a perfect insight into his character. One
might expect that at this age, nineteen, he would be very
romantic and dreamy, and that we should find many allusions
to those topics which engross so much of the time of
novel-reading youths and maidens nowadays. Nothing of the
sort. There is an affair of the heart, but his conduct in it,
with his remarks on it, are worthy of a sexagenarian. At a
party, which took place at his father's, he dances with various
young ladies, among the rest a certain Miss A., who, he
says, "was a great flame of mine two years ago; she is not
so pretty as I thought her then, but she is a delightful
partner. I was again in love, but not violently to-night."
Two or three days after this, he is at another party, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
dances with a new set of partners to the extent of three
quadrilles. Of one of these he thus speaks&mdash;"I was delighted
with Miss B., who is a pleasant unaffected girl, and
I am doomed to think of her I suppose for two or three
days instead of Miss A. I was provoked that she would
not give me her fan at parting." Was it not cool and
thoughtful of him to mark out the time such a change of
sentiment was likely to last? The next page of the journal
brings the subject before us still more clearly. His mother
took him for a walk around Althorp, and told him that she
was planning a house for the parsonage at Brington:
</p>
<p class="cite">
"Which they say is to be mine when I am old enough; it
might be made a most comfortable and even a pretty place,
and if I live to come to it I can figure to myself some
happy years there with a fond partner of my joys, if I can
meet with a good one. 'Here then, and with thee, my N.' [Footnote 2]
would have been my language some time ago; but how my
opinions even of such important things change with my
increasing years. This thought often occurs to me, and will
I hope prevent me from ever making any engagements
which cannot be broken, in case my fancy should be altered
during the time which must elapse before the completion of
them."
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 2: A quotation, as the reader may remember,
  from <i>Guy Mannering</i>.]
</p>
<p>
It will be seen, further on in the biography, how
this affair ended. There is a very good lesson in what he has
left for young men of his age. If reason were allowed to
direct the affections, many would be preserved from rash
steps that embitter their whole lives. It seems amusing to
a Catholic to find the prospects of a clergyman's happiness so
very commonplace; but it will be a relief to learn by-and-by
how very different were his ideas when he became a
clergyman, and built and dwelt in that identical parsonage
that now existed only in his own and his mother's mind.
He gets a commission in the Northamptonshire Yeomanry
before returning to Cambridge for Hilary term this year.
</p>
<p>
Studies seem to him a necessary evil now, and he writes
with a kind of a sigh of relief when he notes, a few pages
on, that he has taken his last compulsory lesson in Latin.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
Balls and parties of all kinds are his rage. George and
a friend of his had notice of a ball coming off in Northampton
in a few days, and he heard that his "ladye love"
would be one of the company, so they determined to be
there. He writes letters, gets an invitation for his friend,
and makes all the preparation possible for a week previous.
The day comes, it is rainy; but, no matter, they pack their
best suits into trunks, bring the necessary apparatus for
making a good appearance, they search the town for a conveyance,
and at length procure a team for a tandem at
Jordan's. Off they go, eighteen miles the first stage, then
eight more; they bait their horses and dine; off again for
full sixteen miles. He has also to run the risk of a
cross-examination from whatever members of his family he may
happen to meet at the ball, and to answer the difficult
question, "What brought you here?" It is raining in torrents,
it is a cold February day; but all difficulties appear
trifles to the two young adventurers as they urge their team
over the hills and plains of Northamptonshire. Even
Spencer boasts in his journal that he is now a first-rate
whip. They arrive in high glee, forgetting their hardships
in the glow of anticipation, and are greeted with the bad
news, as they jump from their conveyance, that the ball has
been put off until next month. To make matters worse,
the bearer of these unfavourable tidings assured them that
he wrote to them to give this information, and they had an
additional motive to chagrin in the fact of their having forgotten
to ask for their letters in the hurry and anxiety to
come off. He notes in the journal&mdash;"Feb. 10. We set off
again in our tandem for Cambridge, truly <i>dimissis auribus</i>,
but with a resolution to try again on the 5th March." On
the 5th of March they faithfully carried out this resolution.
The ball took place, but the ladies they were anxious to meet
did not come, so they only half enjoyed the thing. Spencer
took a hack and rode off to Althorp to make his appearance
at his father's. He was very nervous about the prospect of
a meeting with his parents, and having to give an account
of himself. Fortunately the Earl was deep in some measure
for furthering George's happiness, and looked upon his son's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
arrival as an auspicious visit. Everything thus passed off
smoothly, and the youngsters arrived in Cambridge with
their tandem "without accidents, but with two or three
narrow escapes." His journal here has few incidents out of
the ordinary line of his daily life; he learns to wrestle with
success; so as to bring his antagonist to the ground with a
dilapidation of the <i>res vestiaria</i>. He practises a good deal at
jumping, and one day, in clearing a hedge, a bramble caught
his foot, which brought him with violence to the ground;
by this mishap his eye was ornamented with a scar which
gave him some trouble afterwards. He also gets a shying
horse to ride: this noble charger had a particular dislike to
carts: he shied at one in the market-place in Cambridge,
and soon left his rider on the flags. Spencer mounted again,
but found on his return, after a good ride, that his toe was
sprained, and it kept him indoors for five or six days. This
chapter of accidents was amply counterbalanced by the
agreeable fact that he had just attended his twenty-fifth
divinity lecture, and had obtained the certificate which was
to insure him the imposition of his bishop's hands, whenever
he might think it convenient to put himself to the trouble
of going through the ceremony. His course is now coming
to an end; he becomes a freemason, and rises four degrees
in the craft before the end of June. A bishop visits Trinity
College, and standing in solemn grandeur, with a staff of
college officers dressed out in their insignia encircling him,
his lordship delivers a grave expression of his displeasure at
the stupidity some twenty students gave evidence of during
their examination. Spencer comes out in the first class once
more; his brother Frederick is in Cambridge at the time,
and as soon as the result is known they take coach for
London. Here they spend their time agreeably between
dining at home and abroad, going to Covent Garden, and
taking sundry lessons from an Italian dancing-master, until
July 5th, when George returns to Cambridge to take out
his degree. We will hear himself now giving an account of
this great event.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My college labours terminated with the end of the
  second year's college examination for the classes, which took
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
  place on the 1st of June, 1819. On the 5th of June the
  result was declared, when, as I have before said, I was in
  the first class again, and second to Ollivant. This was
  rather a disappointment, and gave me some reasonable
  discontent. For the cause of my not being, as I might
  have expected, as far above the others as I had been the
  year before, I saw clearly was a degree of carelessness in my
  reading, especially of one subject that is, the three first
  sections of Newton's Principia, which were appointed for
  the second year's reading, and for which I had not had a
  taste as for other parts of mathematics. However, the time
  was now past to recover my place, and soon the importance
  of this little matter vanished into nothing. I then went to
  London till the beginning of July, when I returned to
  Cambridge to receive my degree as Master of Arts from the
  Duke of Gloucester, who came in person at the commencement
  of this year to confer the degrees as Chancellor of the
  University, and to be entertained with the best that the
  colleges could raise to offer him in the way of feasts and
  gaieties. My Cambridge cares and troubles were now well-nigh
  past, and I enjoyed greatly the position I held at this
  commencement as steward of the ball, and a sort of leader
  of the gaieties in the presence of the Royal personages,
  because I was the first in rank of those who received their
  honorary degrees.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "From this time there has been a complete cessation with
  me of all mathematical studies, and almost of all my classical,
  to which I have hardly ever again referred. For when
  I again returned to regular study, I had nothing in my mind
  but matters of theology. It was at this time, after leaving
  Cambridge, when I remained principally fixed as an inmate
  in my father's house, till I was settled in the country as a
  clergyman, that I was in the character of what is called a
  young man about town. It was with my dear brother
  Frederick, who was at home at the time, as I before
  observed, that I began in earnest to take a share in the
  enjoyment of London life. I have seen the dangers, the
  pleasures, and the miseries of that career, though all in a
  mitigated degree, from the happy circumstance of my not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
  being left alone to find my way through it, as so many are
  at the age of which I speak. With many, no doubt, the
  life in London is the time for going to the full depth of all
  the evil of which Oxford or Cambridge have given the first
  relish. My father and mother were not like many aged
  veterans in dissipation&mdash;whom in the days when the fashionable
  world was most accounted of by me, I have looked on
  with pity&mdash;who to the last of their strength keep up what
  they can of youth, in pursuing still the round of the gay
  parties of one rising generation after another. They (my
  parents) hardly ever went into society away from home.
  They kept a grand establishment, when in London, at
  Spencer House, as well as at Althorp in the winter, when
  the first society, whether of the political, or the literary and
  scientific, were constantly received. It would, therefore,
  have been unreasonable in me to be fond of going out for
  the sake of society, when, perhaps, none was to be met
  with so interesting as that at home; besides this, my father
  and mother were fond of being surrounded by their family
  circle; and if I or my brothers, when staying with them in
  London, went out from home several times in succession, or
  many times a week, they would generally express some
  disappointment or displeasure; and though I used at the
  time to be sometimes vexed at this kind of restraint, as I
  was at other restraints on what I might have reckoned the
  liberty of a young man, I used generally, even then, to see
  how preferable my condition was. I now most clearly see
  that the feelings of my parents in this matter were most
  reasonable, and that it was a great blessing to me that I
  was situated in such circumstances. They were desirous
  that we should see the world, and when any amusement
  was going on, or party was to take place, which she thought
  really worthy of attention, as not being so frivolous as the
  general run of such things, my mother zealously assisted in
  procuring us invitations, and providing us with needful
  dresses; as, for instance, at this time she gave to my brother
  Frederick and me very handsome full-dress uniforms (his
  being, of course, that of a naval officer, mine of the
  Northamptonshire Yeomanry, in which I then held a commission),
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
  that we might appear at balls and parties where
  full-dress was required, such as foreign ambassadors sometimes
  gave. These were, she thought, really worth going to
  on account of extraordinary or remarkable characters who
  came to them, whether English or foreigners. Thanks to
  their regular domestic habits, and to the strict authority
  which my mother still kept over us all, while being at
  Spencer House, I should have found it almost as difficult as
  in a well-regulated college to go into any extravagant irregularities,
  and so I was hardly tempted to do so. My feeling
  habitually was to try and avoid invitations and engagements
  from home, far from seeking them eagerly."
</p>
<p>
The incidents we are able to add from his journal during
the interval between leaving Cambridge and going abroad
are very meagre, yet, since they are characteristic of the
man's feelings, a few will be inserted. From the journal:
"Tuesday, July 20. We got up and went to a dreadful
formal breakfast at 10. At one we were dressed, and the
company began to arrive for a public breakfast, to be given
to-day to the people of the county in honour of the marriage
of Lord Temple. The collation was in the greenhouse, and
lasted off and on till about 6!" He goes through the particulars
of the entertainment, the quadrilles and country
dances, the partners' perfections, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but when Lady
Buckingham asked himself and his brother to stay a little
while longer, much as they liked it, they would not do so,
because their mother desired them to be home at a certain
time. One must admire his obedience even at the expense
of his enjoyment, when he might calculate upon the implicit
consent of his mother to their acceding to such a request, and
from such a quarter. Another thing we gather from this is,
that F. Ignatius, even when a youth, could never bear what
was formal or ultra-refined; he always liked natural ease and
unaffected simplicity. "We find him turn away from a blue-stocking,
and steal three days' thoughts from his "flame"
to bestow them on one more unaffected and simple. The next
incident he chooses to record is, that the clergyman of the
church he used to attend had gone to spend his honeymoon,
and that a preacher whom he did not admire took his pulpit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
in his absence. There are some partings of friends, and a
great variety of amusements, to fill up the pages for a month
or so. Father Ignatius used to tell a very remarkable anecdote
about this period of his life; he used it to illustrate
the sacrifices that people can willingly make for the law of
fashion, and how reluctant they are to make even the smallest
for the love of God. There was a great ball to be given
somewhere in London; it was to be a most splendid affair,
full in all particulars of dress and etiquette, and one of those
that the Countess Spencer thought really worth going to.
A celebrated <i>coiffeur</i> was imported direct from Paris, and
he had a peculiar style of hair-dressing that none of that
craft in London could hope to imitate with success. All the
<i>belles</i>, marchionesses of high degree, who intended figuring
at the ball, hired the French <i>coiffeur</i>. He accepted all the
engagements, but found they were so many that it would
take twenty-four hours' hard work, without a moment's
repose, to satisfy all. He had to begin at three o'clock in
the afternoon of the day preceding the ball, and Father
Ignatius knew one lady who was high upon his list. She had
her hair dressed about four, and, lest it might be disarranged,
slept in her arm-chair, with her neck in stocks, for the night.
This lady, be it remembered, was no foolish young <i>belle</i>, but
a matron who might have conveniently introduced her
granddaughter to the circle she attended. "These people,"
he used to say, "laugh at the folly of St. Peter of Alcantara
and other mortified saints; and we, who aspire to be saints,
will undergo with difficulty what worldlings cheerfully
endure for vanity and folly." He often laughed at this,
and often laughed others into seriousness at his comments
on it.

<br>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br>
Travels On The Continent.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Spencer's thoughts now seemed perpetually fluttering around
the expectation of going abroad and seeing wonders. This
idea comes out at most unexpected times in the journal, it
forms a parenthesis in everything he considers bearing seriously
upon his welfare. At one time he is disappointed in
not having his brother for companion, at another he hopes
his parents will not consider this trip travelling enough for
him; he expects, too, that the parental reins will be slackened
somewhat; and even it crosses his mind, as a kind of
remote probability, that he may perchance be allowed to
take a tour by himself. All that was hopeful in these day-dreams
was gratified, and some of them to an extent that he
was very far from imagining at the time. The great day
did arrive at last; the evening before, the different branches
of the family came to dine at Wimbledon, where the Earl
was then staying. They were very serious, as they were
going "on a formidable expedition next morning." In the
morning, the different articles of luggage were sent before
them on a van; and, after parting with Lords Althorp,
Lyttelton, and their families, the party started for the
Continent. It consisted of Lord and Lady Spencer in one carriage,
George and the physician in another, and the servants
in a third. They had a courier employed, Luigi Cavani,
whose office it was to ride ahead of the cavalcade, and provide
horses and other necessaries at the next stage. They
set sail at Dover at six o'clock on the evening of the 14th
September, and, after what was called a favourable passage,
arrived in Calais the next morning at half-past seven o'clock.
One can leave London Bridge nowadays at the time they
left Dover Harbour, and be in Paris before they landed.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
He says in the autobiography:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It was on the 15th of
  September, 1819, that we landed at Calais a day most
  interesting to me, as I then considered, because the first of
  my setting foot in a foreign land, but much more, I now
  must reckon, as being the first on which I trod Catholic
  ground and entered a Catholic church." In the journal he
  says: "Dr. Wilson and I walked about a little (in Calais)
  to the market-place and the church, both which were extraordinary
  to the greatest degree in my eyes. Sept. 16. We
  breakfasted at eight, and then started on our journey. 1st
  went my father and mother in their carriage with 4 horses;
  2ndly. Dr. Wilson and I in a hired <i>calche</i> with two horses.
  3rd. Drewe and the maids, in one with three horses; and
  last, the <i>fourgon</i>, with 3. This was the order of march. I
  was amused extremely by the difference of this and our
  English posting. The appearance of the postilions is so new
  to me, as they crack their long whips over their heads, and
  the little horses with their rope harness look so mean.
  Luigi rode post to order horses and manage everything for
  us, and was always found waiting at every relay."
</p>
<p>
We quote this in full to give an idea of how noblemen
travelled in the not very olden time. If George was much
surprised at the church in Calais, his wonder knew no
bounds when he entered the Cathedral in Amiens, and saw
"Mass performed by separate Priests at different Altars,
and people at each." This is a mystery to Protestants who
see Catholic rites for the first time. They are taught to
look upon true worship as consisting in the meaning of some
well-written sentences, pronounced with emphatic unction,
and responded to with some degree of fervour. The service,
the fine old psalms, anthems, and collects of the Prayer-Book,
issuing forth in melodious accents from the lips of a
God-fearing man, is about the highest kind of public worship
they can have any notion of. The sermon is first with
some, second with others; but whatever place the peculiar
excellence of the preacher, and the effects of it on a given
occasion, may gain in the heart of an individual, it may be
taken for granted that the service comes before the sermon
in the abstract. But service and sermon must be heard, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
listened to, and understood. With this idea in their minds,
and accustomed to see the minister assume a manner and
mien calculated to produce prayerful thoughts in his congregation,
they are surprised, if not shocked, at the Catholic
Mass. They find the Priest hurrying off through Latin
prayers, and producing breathless attention by his own
silence; they see him arrayed in unintelligible attire, moving
one way and another, bowing, genuflecting, standing still,
or blessing. They scarcely understand a word or gesture,
and feel perfectly sure that the old woman who beats her
breast and counts her beads by the side of their staring
effrontery is as much in the dark as themselves, if not more.
They have seen one evidence more of the humbug of
Popery, and bless God that Cranmer procured them another
ritual. It is not our object to explain Catholic mysteries,
but it may be as well to hint that if a stranger to Jerusalem
happened to wander to Calvary on the great day of the
Crucifixion, and believed in the divinity of the Victim who
hung upon the Cross, he would find more devotion in
kneeling in silence at His feet, than in listening to the
most eloquent declamation he could hear about it. Such is
the case with the Catholic now as then; he knows the same
Victim is offered up still, and when the great moment arrives
in the middle of the Mass, he would have everything
to be hushed and silent, except the little bell that gives him
notice of the awful moment. A reason why there should be
people at the different altars lies in this: that there is the
same Sacrifice on each, and one may happen to come into
the church at a time when it would be more convenient to
hear Mass at some one place than at another. The course
of their journey lay through Paris, which they entered from
St. Denis by Montmartre. They remained some days there
to see Notre Dame, and Paris from its summit, admire
the length of the Louvre, and visit Fontainebleau. In the
course they took by Auxerre, Maison Neuve, Dijon, Poligny,
and Morey, in order to cross Mount Jura and to see Mont
Blanc on their way to Switzerland, they have to endure
many privations. The inns are bad, the cooking is inferior,
and they have to undergo discomforts while sleeping in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
the <i>chlets</i> of mountaineers, who were not accustomed to
have their quiet invaded by such state visits every day.
All this they bore manfully until they arrived in Geneva,
which they find "crammed with English." It strikes
George as extraordinary that the Genevese should have
their shops in the top story of their houses. He
misses the morning service in the Calvinist Church on
Sunday; thinks their afternoon function very like the
Scotch, and sensible. He gives vent to his indignation
at finding "a number of blackguard fellows playing cards
and smoking, publicly, at a cafe, whilst there were only
twenty at church." He is disappointed, therefore, at not
finding Geneva the devout, religious place he imagined it to
be. He sees a few of the sights with Dr. Wilson, and they
cross the Lago Maggiore in a boat, whilst the rest of the
company go round it by land. They all meet together in
Milan; there they find Lord Lucan. He goes to see the
<i>Duomo, Brera,</i> theatres; and admires the fine streets, shops,
&amp;c., and says the Cathedral is unique. He had the pleasure
of meeting the famous Angelo, afterwards Cardinal, Mai at
the Ambrosian Library. He went to the Cathedral on
Saturday to see <i>Mass performed</i>, and was disappointed at
not hearing the organ. He had, however, quite enough of
the rite on Sunday, October 17th:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
"At 10 I went to the
<i>Duomo</i>, and got into a little gallery over the choir, from
whence I saw the ceremonies for the anniversary of the
consecration of the church. There was a procession all round
the building, with incense burning, and with the Priests
singing anthems all the time, and a quantity of <i>other mummery</i>,
the sight of which might well have driven Calvin to
the extremities which he went to in the contrary way. The
whole service is always in Latin, so that the people may not
reap even the smallest benefit from it."
</p>
<p>
We shall give
another extract from the journal, as it shows the state of
his mind at the time:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "This day completes the second
  year of my journal. How quick are they flown! those two
  years which are supposed to be the happiest in life. I think
  any time in life is happy if one knows the secret of making
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
  it so. I have not learnt it yet, and have had a great deal
  of unhappiness since going to College. But for what?
  Nothing but my own imagination and weaknesses, for
  everything which generally gives happiness I have enjoyed.
  I have made several friends, been successful enough in my
  College studies, and have never wanted anything; but I
  have a morbid constitution which makes me raise phantoms
  of unhappiness where there is none, and clouds the fairest
  scenes with a veil of melancholy. This must be conquered,
  somehow or other, or I shall be a creature useless to others
  and tormenting to myself."
</p>
<p>
He feels much distaste at what he terms the dirty style
in which an Italian gentleman chooses to live, because
that gentleman finds himself quite comfortable without
such furniture and appliances as are deemed essential in
England. He happened to be a man fond of books, and
spent his spare time in libraries and academies.
</p>
<p>
The travellers leave Milan after a fortnight's stay, and
proceed through Placentia, Parma, Modena, and Bologna.
Here the celebrated Cardinal Mezzofanti called upon them,
and Spencer remarks that the only thing worth seeing, as
far as he has gone, in Italy, are churches and their ornaments.
He singled out one of those latter for special
remark, as we find by the following passage:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Oct. 30.</span> At nine o'clock Dr. Wilson's friend, a
  lawyer, took him and me up to a church on the mountain,
  near the town, famous for a picture&mdash;done, as they say, by
  St. Luke! There is a fine arcade to it for 2 miles, and
  pilgrims go by this to adore this nonsense!"
</p>
<p>
Their next stay is at Florence, where he had the ill-luck
of not providing against mosquitoes, who took the
liberty of biting him heartily the first night he slept there.
News reaches him next day that a great friend of his at
Cambridge, a Mr. Gambler, has obtained a fellowship in
Trinity. This makes him merry all the evening. They
halt again for some rest at Perugia. All he says about this
classic town is, "Before breakfast the Doctor and I saw a
gallery of frightful old pictures, and other <i>maraviglia</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
Perugia, and then set off, still through mountainous
country, to Spoleto. They start for Rome next day, they
see it fifteen miles off, but he does not seem to have had a
single spark of enthusiasm as he looks upon the great mistress
of the world for the first time. Of course Rome, as
the capital of Christendom, was not likely to stir up his
best feelings, when we remember the then frame of his
religious mind. At all events, cold and listless as it
might be, he entered Rome on Wednesday, the 10th November,
1819. The first thing he and his father with the
Doctor did on arriving, was to pay a visit to St. Peter's.
"We saw it inside and out. It was most glorious: but its
size from some reason or other disappoints me, as it does all
strangers; it improves upon acquaintance, I fancy." How
like Byron's opinion. "Childe Harold:" Canto iv. 65:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
        "Enter: its grandeur overwhelms thee not;
        And why? it is not lessened: but thy mind,
        Expanded by the Genius of the spot,
        Has grown colossal, and can only find
        A fit abode wherein appear enshrined
        Thy hopes of immortality; and thou
        Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined,
        See thy God face to face, as thou dost now
    His Holy of Holies, nor be blasted by His brow."
</pre>
<p>
He visits next the Capitoline, the ancient Forum, and
the Coliseum; he remarks: "this last is quite stupendous,
and quite answers my expectations. I could not yet understand
the plan of the staircases and seats. <i>The Pope has
stuck it all over with little chapels</i>." He meets Tom Moore,
and spends a day with him and other merry companions in
Tivoli.
</p>
<p>
He stayed in Rome this time only a week: for on the
17th November they all started for Naples. In passing
through Terracina he meets what Catholics will recognize
as a <i>svegliarino</i>. It is customary, when a mission is being
given in some parts of Italy, for one of the missioners to
go out, accompanied by a bell, and such companions, lay
and clerical, as wish to take part in the ceremony, go
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
around the village, and preach from a table in three or
four different places. This has a remarkable effect&mdash;the
listless loungers who prefer basking in the sun, or swallowing
maccaroni, to going to the church for the sermons, are
thus roused so far as to put their heads out of the window
or door and ask what's the matter. By-and-bye the crowd
thickens, one looks inquisitively at the other, and when
their curiosity has been worked upon sufficiently, the
missioner gets up, and in a fiery zealous discourse puts the
fear of God into his hearers. Thousands are brought to
repentance by these means every year. The sermon, of
course, is not a polished oration, with points of rhetoric to
suit the laws of criticism. It is rather broken and inflamed,
short and telling sentences, and delivered with all that
unction and impetuosity for which Italians are remarkable;
and which is anything but intelligible to an Englishman,
who is accustomed to the measured discourses of a London
Churchman. Accordingly we find this proceeding thus
dotted down in the journal:&mdash;"At Terracina we were very
much <i>amused</i> by a procession of penitents with the Bishop
of Terracina, and an extravagant sermon preached by a
priest from a table before the inn." At that time, how
little could he foresee that he should afterwards give such a
mission in Italy himself, and further, to the utmost of his
power, with equal zeal, though with more sedateness, even
such an <i>extravaganza</i>, as it now appeared to him. His
style of preaching, however, as we shall hereafter see, was
never such as to qualify him for an emphatic <i>svegliarino</i>.
</p>
<p>
On November 21 they arrive in Naples, not very pleasantly,
as Lady Spencer had suffered from the roughness
of the road, and was obliged to rest a night in Capua, and
George was suffering from a soreness in his eye. These
inconveniences were forgotten for a moment on meeting
Lord George Quin and his lady, daughter to Lord Spencer.
Young Spencer was delighted with the children, though
they could only speak French or Italian. The soreness of
his eye keeps him at home next day, which he enjoys as he
has full opportunity of chatting with his sister, whom he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
seems to have loved very much. He has already alluded to
the plan his mother formed for his learning to play on the
guitar; so we shall not quote any of the handsome greetings
which the guitar-master receives as he comes to inflict the
penance of making his pupil tune the strings of this
romantic instrument.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
<br>
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br>
English Life In Naples.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The English who wintered in Naples at the same time
with the Spencer family seemed to have formed, as they
generally do, a special caste. They dined together, drove
out together, they laughed at the churches, and crowded
the opera. Their conduct in the latter place did not
seem to be very edifying to the Neapolitans, who, perhaps,
may have thought it was an English custom to see a
nobleman "tumbling tipsy one night into Earl Spencer's
box," to the no small disedification of the whole family,
who were models of sobriety and decorum. The English,
by forming their own circles in this exclusive manner,
and by their external deportment on various occasions,
keep away the higher and more pious grades of
society in Catholic cities. The scoffers at monachism and
priestly rule are freely admitted within the English pale,
and pay for their hospitality, by catering to the worst
prejudices of their entertainers, and maligning their neighbours.
It is very often a repetition of the fable of the sour
grapes. For this we have ample testimony in the writings
of our contemporaries, which we will strengthen by quoting
Father Ignatius's own words a little later. The better
Italians sometimes laugh at all this, so that John Bull is
become a by-word among them for exclusiveness and arrogant,
selfish pride. The blame lies with the English.
</p>
<p>
They sometimes found disagreeable incidents from the
clashing of tastes and customs. On the 8th of December
they made the round of the churches, but were sorely
piqued that the Neapolitans had too much respect for our
Blessed Lady to open the operas and theatres on the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
of the Feast of her Immaculate Conception, so they had to
content themselves with whist, and discordant notes from
George's guitar. Another of these crosses occurred a few
days after. George made a lame excursion to Vesuvius,
and when groaning from toothache on his return, heard
that the father of his bosom friend, Sir Thomas Fremantle,
senior, was dead. To make matters worse, the remains could
not be interred in a cemetery, and the <i>Inglesi</i> had to pay
the last sad rites to their friend in a private garden. On
Christmas Day they had service at the Consul's, and then
they walked about, and had their whist for the rest of the
day. The old year was danced out at a grand quadrille
party, of which more hereafter; and George tells us very
carefully that "a set of us drank in the new year in
<i>diavolone</i>." How remarkable, at every turn, and even by
such chance and off-hand expressions, to note the contrast
between the George Spencer of that day and the subject of
divine grace he afterwards became!
</p>
<p>
It is a relief to begin the new year 1820 with recording
an exception made to the general custom above. George
was presented by his father to King Ferdinand, and all the
<i>nobili Inglesi</i> were invited to join in the festivities with
which it was customary to usher in the new year. For
the rest, the evenings and early part of the mornings are
spent in a continual whirl of amusement, and it would
require a page to number up the balls and dances he figured
in. He visits also the Carthusian and Camaldolese monasteries,
but makes no comments. He goes two or three times
to see Vesuvius and the crater and the lava, of which he
gives a very nice description; after this he is allowed, by
special favour, to be at the Royal chase: this puts him in
great humour, for, besides the sport it afforded in the
way of getting shots at such choice game as wild boars, it
gave him an opportunity of seeing the "King and all his
court, to which nothing can be similar."
</p>
<p>
Towards the end of January, Lord and Lady Spencer
determined on returning to England, and offered to leave
George to travel through the sights of Southern Italy. He
perceives, in a few days, the tokens of an inclination in his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
parents to have his company, and goes straightway to the
Honourable Augustus Barrington, who was to be his fellow-traveller,
and breaks off the plan they had formed. It was
only after very pressing instances from his father and mother
that he could be persuaded to take up the first plan anew.
A portion of his autobiography will throw some light upon
many things we have only just touched upon, and, therefore,
it is better to quote it here, though it might come in more
opportunely at the conclusion of his first tour abroad.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is extraordinary, indeed, that I should have remained
  a whole year on the Continent and never once have seriously
  taken into consideration the subject of the Catholic religion.
  Such was the case; and I returned to England, as far as I
  can remember, without one doubt having crossed my mind
  whether this was the true religion or not. ...
</p>
<p class="cite">
  And now for a little recollection of the state of my mind
  during this period of travelling, and its moral effects
  upon me. During all this time I continued, thank God,
  wholly convinced that a course of iniquity would not
  answer; and had I met with any among the young men,
  my associates, who would have dared to speak out fully in
  favour of morality, I should, I believe, have been ready to
  agree with him. But where were such to be found? I had
  now grown so far more independent of the world, that I had
  not open assaults to bear continually against for not running
  with the rest. Many of the young men who maintained
  their character as free licentious livers, yet professed some
  degree of moderation and restraint in their indulgences.
  Some I remember, who professed to keep clear of immoral
  practices, and no doubt their sincerity in this might be
  depended on; for where no credit but dishonour would be
  the reward of steady conduct, there was no temptation to
  pretend to it falsely. But I remember now but one who
  dared to allude in my hearing&mdash;and that was but once, I
  think, in private&mdash;to the consequence of this sin in another
  world, and to maintain that it was better to avoid it for
  fear of punishment hereafter. While, then, I still knew
  that the way of evil was all wrong, and would have been
  most happy if the fashion of wickedness could have been at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
  an end; and though I never once, as far as I know, was the
  first to introduce immodest conversation, and hardly ever
  heard it introduced by others without inward repugnance,
  and seldom joined in it; yet I never dared declare how
  much I hated it, and was still in the most awful and desperate
  state of wishing I had been like the worst, sooner
  than be thus subject to the torment of being put to shame
  before bold profligates. While with my parents, I have
  before said, I was under good surveillance, and could not
  think of being detected by them in any evil. How shall I
  ever be thankful enough for all this? My father's character
  was such that though many who were often in his company
  were men whom I have known, when out of it, to delight
  in most abominable things, I knew of none who ever dared
  in his sight to do more than covertly allude to them. I was
  therefore happy in this respect whenever he was near;
  but when once more left to myself, I again returned to
  those fearful deliberations of which I have before spoken
  of, as it were, selling myself, for a time at least, to work
  wickedness without restraint. It may be well conceived
  how miserably fallen and corrupt must have been my heart
  when such purposes were entertained within it; and if, partly
  through some remains of the holy impressions of my childhood,
  which still operated on my poor, degraded heart as a
  kind of habit not yet quite worn off; partly by a sense of
  the shame and misery I should have before my family and
  some more whom I knew in the world, who would be themselves
  most afflicted if they heard of my fall from the good
  dispositions which they had known in me; partly from a fear of
  ridicule, even from the profligate, if, after all, I was to fell;
  partly by the wonderful providence of God, which (I acknowledge)
  most wisely and most tenderly, yet strongly interposed
  at times to baffle the madness of my designs when about to
  be accomplished&mdash;if, I say, thus I have been in a degree
  preserved, God knows I have no credit due to me: God
  knows that from my heart I take only shame and confusion
  of face to myself in the remembrance, of my very preservation.
  Towards the latter part of my stay abroad, I began
  to be in some way weary of this uncertain state of mind. I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
  was always expecting to take Orders when I should reach
  the age; and as I knew that then I should not be expected
  by the world to join in its fashionable vices, and should even
  suffer in public estimation if I did, my thoughts began to
  be rather better directed, and I took pains from time to
  time to overcome some of the evil that was in me."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is wonderful that any good disposition should have
  lived within me, when every remembrance of religion seems
  to have been put out of my mind. I now could hardly
  understand how this should have indeed been the case, if I
  had not a clear remembrance of certain circumstances which
  plainly show what was the state of my mind. On the 27th
  January, 1820, I went up Mount Vesuvius with Dr. Wilson,
  when, as we were looking into the crater of the volcano, a
  discharge of red-hot stones took place. I heard them whistle
  by me as they ascended, and though it was of no use to
  attempt to get out of the way, I hurried back a few steps by a
  natural impulse, and immediately saw a lump of red-hot stuff
  twice the size of one's head fall on the spot where I had been
  standing just before. We immediately ran down the side
  of the mountain, and reached a place about a quarter of a
  mile distant from the mouth of the crater, from whence we
  could see the upper cone of the mountain. Just then a
  grand explosion took place, which shook the whole mountain,
  and a vast quantity of these masses of fiery red stuff
  was spouted out from the crater, which in its return appeared
  entirely to cover the whole space over which we had been
  running five minutes before. Here was an evident escape
  which, in a mind possessed with any religion at all, could
  not fail of awakening some serious reflections. Alas! I
  never thought of the abyss into which I must have fallen
  had not the good angel, who watched and guided me through
  so many perils which I thought not of, then preserved me.
  When I came down in the evening to Naples, the only effect
  was that I was pleased and vain at having a good adventure
  to relate, and showing off a spirit of bravery and indifference,
  when some blamed me for my rashness.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Another circumstance I may record to show how free
  from all religious fear my mind was. I have before noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
  the fits of melancholy which became habitual to me during
  the last part of my Cambridge life. These came, I think,
  to their greatest height in the last half of the time I spent
  at Naples. The interesting excitement of our journey, the
  company of my sister when I first came to Naples, and the
  gaieties of which I had my fill there, and which at first had
  all the charm of novelty, kept me from much thought of
  any kind, and I enjoyed the balls, the concerts, the grand
  operas, the enchanting rides of Naples, for a month or six
  weeks, almost without a cloud. At least I used always to
  count that my brightest period in the way of enjoyments.
  Unhappy those who have health and spirits and talents to
  enable them to please and be pleased long together in such
  a round of vanity! To my great vexation I found myself
  again attacked with my old enemy, melancholy; do what I
  would, I could not drive away those fits of gloom. They
  were caused partly by the effect on my health of too much
  good living, and bad hours; but the chief cause was the
  intrinsic worthlessness of all such pleasure, which will discover
  itself sooner or later to every one even of its most
  devoted lovers, and which happily showed itself to me sooner
  than others. Oh! what frivolous causes did my happiness
  then seem to depend on! Not dancing to my satisfaction
  in one quadrille, fancying that some of my favourite partners
  were tired of my conversation, and that the nonsense of
  some other silly youth pleased her better, was enough to
  turn what I flattered myself was about to be a bright and
  pleasant evening into gloom and sadness. Sometimes, without
  an assignable cause, my spirits failed, as at others an
  equally frivolous reason would remove my clouds and make
  me bright again; but gradually the gloomy moods gained
  ground, and grew more dark and tedious. I remember comparing
  notes with another young man, who was like me a
  victim of the dumps, and finding some satisfaction in the
  sympathy of a fellow-sufferer, who, with a smile at the
  absurdity of such feelings, of which he was well sensible
  while he avowed them, exactly described to me my state of
  mind when he said that under them he fancied himself the
  most unfortunate of mankind, and would willingly have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
  changed places with the most despicable and wretched of
  men, not to say with any animal almost. Poor blind fools
  that we were! We could not between us suggest the way
  to be happy which is open to all.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I remember well coming home one night from a ball,
  which, by my journal, I find to be on the 25th January,
  when, as I wrote at that time, I was more miserable than
  ever I was in that way. I went to bed, and heard a noise
  like a creak in the ceiling of my room. I felt a wish that it
  would break through and crush me. How I used to wish at
  that time I had the sort of bold, firm heart which appeared
  through some of the young manly faces which I used daily
  to meet&mdash;to whom low spirits was a thing unknown. I
  knew not that I was quarrelling with the most choice of
  God's mercies to me, without which I should probably have
  been irrevocably lost. I still, to this day, am used to the
  visits of my feelings of dejection, but, thank God, I know
  better how to receive them; and, far from wishing them
  away, I rather fear their departure, and desire they may
  never leave me. For if I have within me one bright, heavenly
  desire, I owe it to these feelings, which first poisoned
  my pleasure in the world, and drew me at length to seek for
  it elsewhere, and now I wish never to have peace within my
  breast while one desire lives there for anything but God.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Yet that thought of wishing even to be crushed, that I
  might escape from my miserable feelings, shows how far
  I was at that time from knowing how great a cause for
  sorrow I really had in the state of my soul&mdash;which, if I had
  known it, must have driven away all imaginary griefs&mdash;nor
  from what quarter I should seek for happiness; and it is a
  wonder that it took so long a time, and so many repetitions
  of the same lesson, before I began to correspond with the
  gracious purpose of my Heavenly Teacher; of Him who
  was thus correcting me, that I might at length love Him,
  and love Him willingly. How was it that I could have
  lived so long without being awakened to one sentiment of
  religious fear? ...

  "But now we must return to the Catholic Faith. The
  main object of this memoir being to trace the steps of my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
  progress towards Catholicity, it would be expected that the
  period of my residence for a whole year in Catholic countries
  must be most interesting. Indeed it is wonderful that
  this year of my life should have been, as it appears to me to
  have been, quite neutral in its effects. I certainly made no
  progress towards my present faith. This would not be
  extraordinary; for how many Protestants by their travels
  abroad not only make no progress towards Catholicity, but
  are made its violent enemies. But, undoubtedly, this was
  the effect produced on me. It seems that at this time I was
  under the influence of altogether other objects and notions
  from any connected with religion. What I sought was,
  first, my own pleasure&mdash;next, only general information;
  what I was chiefly controlled by was human respect.
  Having no care at all about religion in any form, the
  question of which was the right form never troubled me, and
  so the observations which I could not help making on the
  Catholic religious practices which I saw, were very superficial.
  It might be interesting to transcribe a few passages
  from my journal which show what was my mind.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is remarkable how easily one's mind takes in and
  rests contented in the belief of false and prejudicial
  representations of things. I never had had much pains taken
  with me to set me against the Catholic religion; but though
  I knew nothing of what it was, I rested in the conviction
  that it was full of superstition, and, in fact, as good as no
  religion at all. I never opened my mind all the time I was
  abroad to the admission of any idea but this; and so I
  looked on all the Catholic ceremonies which I saw, in this
  perverted light. I did not fall in the way of anyone to set
  me right; for I was contented to go on in the stream of the
  English society with which almost all the towns in Italy
  were filled, and if any really zealous exemplary Catholics
  are sometimes mingled with them, they do not find it available
  or prudent to introduce the mention of religion; while
  there will be always some who have no objection to seek to
  please them by encouraging their prejudices, which they do
  effectually by telling stories&mdash;some true, perhaps, some
  obviously false&mdash;of the Priests and Religious. Such a person,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
  who bore the title of Abbate, and therefore must have been
  professedly a true Catholic, we fell in with at Milan; he
  assisted my father in his search after curious books. I
  remember some of his conversations, and I find notice in my
  journal of his dining with us, and being 'very amusing in
  some stories about the Catholic processions.' The impression
  on my mind was that the whole system of religion
  which we saw was mere formality, people being taught to
  content themselves with fulfilling some external rules, and
  the clergy making it their business to keep them in the
  dark. I took little notice of religious matters till we entered
  Italy. There Milan was the first town we stopped at.
  On the Sunday after our arrival was the anniversary of the
  consecration of the church. I saw the ceremonies in the
  Cathedral, the very place where St. Augustine's heart was
  moved and his conversion begun, by hearing the strains of
  holy music, perhaps the same which I then heard. But
  very different was the effect on me; here are the wise remarks
  inserted in my journal."[Footnote 3]

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br>
Continuation Of His Travels.</h2>
<br>
<p>
After staying about three months in Naples, Spencer sets
out with Barrington, to travel through Sicily, on the 27th
February. The voyage was very smooth until they came
to Stromboli, and passed near the cave of AEolus, who
"puffed at them accordingly," and delayed their landing at
Messina until March 2. He goes to a ceremony in the
cathedral there, and says, "the priests seem nourishing and
very numerous here." On his way to Mount Etna he remarks,
with a kind of incredulous air, that he went to see
the lions of the five chestnuts and the bridge, which has the
same legend attached to its origin as the Devil's Bridge in
Wales, "dogs being, in both cases, sent over first to pay the
forfeit for having built it." [Footnote 4]
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 4:
  The most circumstantial legend bearing upon the remark in the
  text is that about the Bridge of Rimini. Here there was a fearful
  rapid, without a stone within the distance of 70 miles that was
  available for building purposes. The bridge-builder of the town
  may or may not have had the contract; but, at all events, he set
  down in a confused state of mind as to how it might be done. The
  devil appeared to him and contracted for the building of the bridge
  on these easy terms&mdash;getting the first that crossed it for his own.
  The bargain was struck, and in the twinkling of an eye some
  thousands of infernal imps were scampering down the mountains
  with a gigantic stone on the shoulder of each. One-third of them
  were quite sufficient, and the arch-fiend who presided over the
  building cried out, that no more were wanted: when each devil
  threw down his load where he happened to be when the master's
  yell reached his ears. This is said to account for the rocks one
  sees strewn about near this bridge. The bridge itself is a circle,
  and was built in one night, and indeed some kind of infernal
  machine would seem necessary to remove the blocks of stone of
  which it is composed. Now came the trial. The Christian builder of
  bridges had no fancy for going to hell, and he was too charitable to
  send anyone else there. He bethought him of an expedient, and
  calling out his dog he took a small loaf, and threw it across the
  bridge with all his might. The dog, of course, ran after it. Whereupon
  the devil seized him, and in a rage flung him up to somewhere
  near the moon, and the dog falling from this height upon the
  bridge, made a hole in its only arch which cannot be filled up to this
  day. The legend embodies at least a specimen of the Catholic
  instinct: viz., the anxiety of the devil for our destruction, and how
  all hell thinks it cheap to turn out for a day's hard labour in the
  hopes of gaining one single soul.]
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
<p>
He chiefly lodges in convents
during his rambles through Sicily, the inns being so very
bad that they drive travellers away. He and his companion
sleep in different convents, and are very well treated; but
that scarcely evokes a word of thanks. Poor monks! they
have a bad name in Protestant nations, and what would be
praiseworthy in others is only an equivocal quality in them.
This is very sad; that men who have bid farewell to the
world should, on that very account, be considered hardly
entitled to the bare rights of human beings. Yet go on, poor
souls, in your vocation; your Master before you received the
same treatment from the world, and you are not greater than
He. Spencer meets one or two monks whom he likes pretty
well&mdash;one was the superior of the Carmelites at Grirgenti.
The rest he calls "stupid friars," "lazy monks," and so forth,
according to the tone of mind he happens to be in. In one
monastery they shut the door of the room allowed them in
the face of one of the brethren, because, forsooth, they were
"bored by visits from the monks." His journey does not
always lie through convents, and he meets others who are
not monks; one of these was a wine-merchant at Marsala, a
native of England. It seems the pair of tourists were received
as handsomely by their countryman as they had been
by the "stupid friars," for he is thus described in the
journal: "He seems to think himself commissioned to keep
up the English character in a strange land, for he is a John
Bull in caricature in his manner." We are also told, a little
lower down, that he is very hospitable to all English who
pass by that way. They had the novelty of seeing an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
Italian Good Friday in Marsala; the impression is thus
noted:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Friday, Mar. 31.&mdash;</span>
  This was Good Friday. The
  first, and I hope the last, I shall spend without going to
  church; not that I should not like to be abroad another
  year. We were reminded of the day by quantities of groups
  representing the Passion and Crucifixion, almost as large as
  life, carried about on men's shoulders, which, absurd as they
  are, seemed to make an impression on the populace. Men
  dressed in black accompanied them, with crowns of thorns
  and crosses. It strikes me as direct idolatry, nearly. The
  gentry were all in mourning, and the sentinels had their
  muskets with the muzzles inverted. We all three (Sir H.
  Willoughby accompanied Barrington and Spencer) took a
  walk up to the top of Monte di Trapani, the ancient Eryx,
  where is a town of the same name. We examined what
  was to be seen there, and came down again to dinner. We
  dined at 6, and had <i>some meat</i>, which we have not been
  able to get for some days, it being Passion Week." He
  spent Easter Sunday in Palermo, and here are his comments
  on its observance:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Sunday, April 2, Easter-day.&mdash;</span>
  We set off from Ahamo about 7. I walked on for an hour, and
  then rode forward all the way to Monreale, where I stopped
  an hour till the others came up. We then proceeded together
  to Palermo. In the villages we passed, the people
  were all out in their best clothes, which was a very pretty
  sight. Bells were clattering everywhere, and <i>feux de joie</i>
  were fired in several villages as we passed, with a row of
  little tubes loaded with gunpowder, in the market-places,
  and processions went about of people in fancy dresses with
  flags and drums. This religion is most extraordinary. It
  strikes me as impious; but I suppose it takes possession of
  the common people sooner than a sensible one."
</p>
<p>
He completed
the tour of the island by arriving in Messina, after a
most successful attempt to see Mount Etna, on the 14th of
April. They left Sicily for Reggio in a boat, and arrived
there "with a good ducking." They both went to visit
Scylla, which was guarded as a citadel by armed peasants.
The sturdy yeomen refused to admit them, whereupon
George, with true English curiosity, climbed up the wall to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
get a peep at the sea, and perhaps inside. Scarcely had he
got half-way up when he was taken prisoner by the sentinel.
He was accordingly invited to visit the interior of the castle,
and had to gaze at the bleak walls of its keep for an hour,
until Willoughby procured his release from the commandant.
They travelled on, and George does not seem to be satisfied
with the people of Salerno, whom he designates as "surly
and gothic." He heard his companions had to get an escort
of gendarmes, to save them from robbers, all along here.
Returns to Naples, April 26, delighted at being safe in life
and limb; he goes to the old lodgings to a party, and reflects
thus on his return: "I came home about one, rather sad
with seeing the representation of what I had enjoyed in the
winter&mdash;but all the people changed. <i>Gaiety after all does
not pay</i>." This last sentence is not underlined by Spencer
himself. It is done to point a moral that may be necessary
for a certain class of persons. It is often supposed that
monks, and the like people, paint the world blacker than it
is in reality, and that it is a kind of morose sourness of
disposition that makes recluses cry down the enjoyments of
those outside convent-walls. This line will perhaps defend
F. Ignatius from such an imputation. He wrote that after
the pure natural enjoyment of scenery had been compared
with the excitement of a ball-room; if he thought, in his
wildness, that gaiety did not pay, no wonder that his
opinion was confirmed in the quiet tameness of his after-life.
A passage from the autobiography, omitted above, comes in
here opportunely. He was speaking of the absence of the
fear of God from his miserable mind:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "This was almost true concerning the entire period.
  One occasion I will mention when I was impressed with
  some shame at my wretched state. While I was making
  the tour of Sicily, my father and mother left Naples in the
  <i>Revolutionnaire</i>, a fine frigate which had been placed at their
  disposal, and by which they went to Marseilles, to shorten
  their land journey homewards. When I returned to Naples
  I found a long letter from my father, full of kindness and
  affection for me, in which he explained to me his wishes as
  to the course of my journey home. This letter I believe I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
  have not kept, but I remember in it a passage nearly as
  follows: 'As to your conduct, my dear George, I need not
  tell you how important it is for your future happiness and
  character that you should keep yourself from all evil;
  especially considering the sacred profession for which you are
  intended. But, on this subject, I have no wish concerning
  you but to hear that you continue to be what you have
  hitherto been.' 'Ah!' thought I to myself, 'how horrible
  is the difference between what I am and what this sentence
  represents me.' But worldly shame was yet more powerful
  in me than godly shame, and this salutary impression did
  not produce one good resolution."

On May 3rd, 1820, he came to Rome a second time. His
first visit this time also was to St. Peter's, which, he says,
"looked more superb to me than ever." He attended
Cardinal Litta's funeral from curiosity, and has no remark
about it worth extracting. There are two passages in the
journal relating to the ceremonies of Ascension Thursday
and Corpus Christi, which may be interesting as being
indicative of his notions of Catholic ritual:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Thursday, May 11.&mdash;</span>
  Got up early, and wrote till breakfast.
  At 9 went off with Barrington and Ford to St. John
  of Lateran, where there were great ceremonies to take place
  for the Ascension Day. The old Pope was there, and was
  carried round the church blessing, with other mummeries.
  It was a fine sight when he knelt down and prayed (or was
  supposed to do so) in the middle of the church, with all the
  Cardinals behind him. Now this goes for nothing in comparison
  to what it must have been when the Pope was really
  considered infallible (<i>sic</i>). We then all went out of the church
  to receive the blessing, from the principal window in the
  faade. The Pope came to this in his chair, and performed
  the spreading of his hands very becomingly. The whole
  thing was too protracted, perhaps, to be as striking as it
  should; but I was not as disappointed as I expected to be.
  The cannonry of St. Angelo and the band certainly gave
  effect; and the crowd of people on the space before the church
  was a scene to look at."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Thursday, June 1.&mdash;</span>
  To-day is the feast of Corpus
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
  Domini, one of the greatest in the Catholic Church; so at
  eight we went, having breakfasted [a fact, by the bye, he
  seldom omits to mention], to St. Peter's, to see the <i>funzioni</i>,
  which are very grand on this occasion. There was a great
  procession round the <i>cortile</i>&mdash;first of the religious orders,
  about 450 monks only; and the boys of St. Michael's Hospital,
  of the Collegio Romano, &amp;c. Then came curates, and
  priests temporal and secular, prelates, and monsignores, the
  ensigns or canopies of the seven basilicas with their chapters,
  and the priests belonging to them following; next came
  bishops, then cardinals, and then the Pope, carried on four
  men's shoulders. He was packed up on the top of the stand
  with his head out alone. He seemed more dead than alive,
  and worse than on May 11 at S. Giovanni's. The group of
  people about him, with their robes and splendid mitres, made
  a very brilliant sight. The former part of the procession
  rather showed the decadence of the Church from a great
  height, than its present glory. After the Pope came the
  <i>guardia nobile</i>, and other soldiers, in splendid uniforms.
  After the procession there were functions in the Church,
  and a benediction from the Altar, and which I did not see
  so well. St. Peter's never showed so well as with a crowd
  of people in it, when one may estimate its dimensions from
  the comparison of their littleness."
</p>
<p>
This is a fair specimen of how a candid, prejudiced Protestant
stares at Catholic services. He puts down as undisputed
that all is absurd before he goes, and if the Man of
Sin himself, the poor Pope, is in the middle of it, it rises to
the very highest pitch of abomination. A man who could
consider holiday attire and exultation impious on Easter
Sunday, and the mourning and fasting and processions of
Good Friday something worse, cannot be very well qualified
to comprehend the Ascension and Corpus Christi in Rome.
Catholics <i>do</i> believe in the authority of the Pope and the
power of the Keys, and also in the Real Presence; will it
not follow, as a natural conclusion, that the four quarters of
the globe should get its spiritual Father's blessing one day
in the year, and that we should try to find out the best way
of honouring our Incarnate God in the Blessed Sacrament?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
But consistency is not a gift one finds among Protestants,
especially when they give their opinion on what they think
too absurd to try to understand. They must admit the
Catholic ceremonial is imposing; but then it is only to
quarrel with it for being so. They can understand pageantry
and pomp in honouring an earthly monarch; but does it
occur to them that every best gift is from above, and that
the King of kings should be honoured with every circumstance
of splendour and oblation a creature can offer?
</p>
<p>
One or two of the salient points of his character come
out in a few extracts we shall produce from the journal
now. He says, on leaving Rome&mdash;"How delightful, and
yet how melancholy, was my walk about those dear rooms
at the Vatican; after next Thursday I believe I am never
to see them again, so farewell to them now." This illustrates
his better nature; he was very affectionate, and could love
whatever was really worth loving; he was not very demonstrative
of this feeling, but when it came to leave-taking, he
had to give vent to it. A peculiar caste of his mind was
to listen to every proposition, and weigh the reasons adduced
to support it. If they were unanswerable, he at once
admitted it, and, if possible, tested it by experience. This
was the great key to his conversion and subsequent life. In
conversation, perhaps, with a medical friend, he was told
that it was far the best way, whilst on the move in travelling,
neither to eat nor drink. This was supported by reasons
drawn from the digestive principles, and so forth. He
thought it was well proved, and could find no valid objection
against it, so he determined to try it, and travelled from
Rome to Sienna without tasting a morsel for forty-two
hours, and says in his journal&mdash;"It is much the best way
in travelling." In Florence we have other tokens of the
regret with which he parts from his friends; and in the
same page a very different feeling on parting with some
Franciscans. These "entertained him uncommonly well
for mendicants," and showed him all their treasures of art
and piety with the greatest kindness; yet it did not prevent
him calling them "lazy old monks" when they let him away
at three o'clock in the morning.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
<p>
He walks about the country a good deal, and finds it
pleasant, "as the common people here are much more conversable
than ours." This striking difference between a
Catholic and a Protestant peasantry is patent to the most
superficial observer. The poor Irish, French, or Italian
labourer, who can neither read nor write, is quite at his
ease with the merchant or the noble. He will have his joke
and his laugh, very often at the expense of his superior,
and never outstep the bounds of due respect. He is light-hearted
and gay everywhere, and the exact opposite of the
English navvy.
</p>
<p>
The real cause of the difference is the want of religion
in the poor Briton. The Catholic religion inculcates
humility on the great. It brings the Lord of the Manor
and his servant to the same confessional and the same
altar: they may be as far asunder as pole from pole outside
the church, but inside it they are both on a level. The
works of mercy are insisted on, and high-born ladies are
most frequently the ministering angels of the poor man's
sick-bed, and the instructors of his children, and nurses of
his orphans. "Blessed are the poor" is not a dead letter
in Catholic theology, and until it be, and that poverty
becomes felony, the same ease and happiness will pervade
the peasantry of Catholic countries, which now gives them
such grace and beauty. The doctrine of self-worship and
money-adoration can never fuse races; there is a wide wide
chasm between the upper and the lower orders in Protestant
countries, which no amount of mechanics' lectures, and
patronizing condescension, can bridge over, as long as the
germs of the worldly system remain rooted in the education
and manners of the people. Of course, these remarks do
not apply to the general state of things, for there is oppression
in Catholic countries as well as elsewhere; they
simply concern the working of a Christian principle, if it get
fair play.
</p>
<p>
He visits Pisa, Lucca, Carrara, Sestri, and stops at
Genoa. A bit of the Protestant breaks out here. "We
went to see that foolish <i>sacro catino</i> at the Cathedral, which
I have no doubt is glass instead of emerald." He says
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
again: "It makes me rather onked to be alone now, though
sometimes I wish to be so. But the only solitude that is
disagreeable is among numbers in a large town. The solitude
of the Apennines, and such places as last night's habitation,
is a pleasure to me." Now one <i>vetturino</i> hands him
over "to another more blackguard than himself" on his way
to Bologna, where he has a very satisfactory meeting with
Mezzofanti once more. Off he starts through Ferrara,
Rovigo, and Padua, for Venice; he visits the Piazza S.
Marco, and is told complacently by a French doctor, who
proved to be a terrible bore by-and-by, that it is nothing to
the Palais Royal. He visits Mantua on a pilgrimage to
Virgil's birthplace, and says of a sight he saw by accident:
"I was amused by a figure of S. Zeno, just like a smiling
Otaheitan idol of the largest dimensions, which is the great
protector of the town." It is not hard to tell which way
his devotion lay. Spencer and a Mr. Lefevre, who was now
his travelling companion, go to a <i>villegiatura</i> here, and are
splendidly entertained for a couple of days. They travel
on for Germany through the Tyrol; from Verona to Riva
they chiefly travel by the Lago di Garda, and the only incidents
he chooses to record, until they come to "dem goldenen
Adler" (the golden Eagle) at Brixen, are the cicerone's
opinions of Catullus, whom that well-informed individual
thought to have been a brigand chief. They had to bring
the bill of fare before the police in Riva, but were not successful
in getting a single charge diminished; he enjoyed a
good deal of idyllic life along here, and did not seem to
think much <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i> of the little town of Trent,
though one should fancy he would say something, if it were
only a few angry words about the Great Council.
</p>
<p>
He considers the Germans more honest than the Italians,
and was inclined to admire their solidity and steadiness; but
his driver fell asleep on their way to Innspruck, and let the
reins fall on the horse's neck when descending a steep, and he
veers round to the opinion that if they were a little livelier,
it would be much better. On his way through Bavaria to
Munich he thinks the country very like England&mdash;well
cultivated and flourishing. "The costumes extraordinary,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
but not so pretty as the Tyrolese. The people themselves,
both men and women, are the ugliest race I ever saw."
They had letters of introduction to Prince Loewenstein and
Count Peppenheim, two aides-de-camp of the King of
Bavaria; they were invited to a royal <i>chasse</i>. Perhaps it is
as well to give the whole account from the Journal, as it
conveys an idea of German sports too fine to be overlooked.
</p>
<p class="cite">
 "<span class="quotehead">Monday, Aug. 21.&mdash;</span>
  At 4 this morning we started for
  the <i>chasse</i> in the mountains about three leagues off. At
  the end of two leagues we were stopped and obliged to
  walk, as the road became too narrow for the King to pass
  us, in case we had been in the way when he came up. So we
  walked the rest till we came to the toils where Loewenstein
  received us. The <i>chasse</i> was in a deep valley, shut in on
  the sides by precipitous rocks: into this they had tracked
  about 80 or 90 head of deer, and shut them in by toils at
  both ends; then little green enclosures were made for the
  guns to be posted in. We had one of these guns given us
  in conjunction with other spectators, the shooter who was to
  have been there not having arrived. Before the line was a
  broad course of a torrent, and beyond that was a wood into
  which they had forced the game, and from which they drove
  it again with dogs, and even into the way of the guns. This
  went on for 4 or 5 hours, during which they cannonaded
  very quick, but with little effect, for I never saw a much
  greater proportion of misses. The result was about 70 head
  of deer. We were much surprised in the middle of the
  time at seeing Devon walk up. He came from Salzburg
  for the purpose of this <i>chasse</i>, and stayed with us through
  it. After it we were standing near the place where the King
  was counting out the game, when Peppenheim presented us
  to him, and he asked us to dine at Berchtesgaden. As our
  carriage was so far off, we were obliged to be carried as
  we could, and I was taken in by Loewenstein, who is,
  by the bye, about the fattest man in Bavaria. We dressed
  directly, both ourselves and Devon, who had nothing here;
  and even so we were late for dinner. However, the King
  was so gracious and good-humoured that it all went off
  capitally. It was an interesting dinner for the faces that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
  we saw. Eugene Beauharnais, Prince Schwartzenberg,
  Reichenbach, engineer, Marehal Wrede, and about 16
  more, were there. We stayed till about 6, and then came
  home.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Tuesday, Aug. 22.&mdash;</span>
  To-day we again followed the
  motions of the Court. Devon came over with horses from
  Hallein, where he had returned last night; and so we went
  about comfortably. Schwartzenberg took us to a famous
  machine of Mr. Reichenbach's, without the King. This
  machine is employed to raise the salt water, which is brought
  from the mines here, and convey it over the mountains to
  Reichenhall, about 3 leagues distant, where is a manufactory
  for extracting the salt. The reason of this is, that there
  is not enough wood for consumption here. It is a vast
  forcing-pump, which is worked by fresh water from a height
  of 400 feet, and raises the salt water 1,200. This water is
  in the proportion of 53 to 44 heavier than fresh water. I
  did not understand the whole explanation, being in German,
  but I admired the machine, which works in a room so
  quietly as actually not to be perceptible from the noise,
  except a little splashing. After this we came to a miserable
  dinner at the inn, which was too full to attend to us. At
  1, about, we started again to a romantic lake, Knig See,
  where another scene of this royal drama was to be enacted.
  The King came, with his whole party, an hour after us, and
  we were invited by Loewenstein into his royal boat, which
  was rowed by 11 men and one pretty damsel. "We went all
  down the lake, with several other boats full following, one
  of which had 4 small cannons, which they constantly
  discharged for the echo. The thing we came though for was,
  two artificial cascades from the top of the mountains, one in
  the course of a small torrent, which had been stopped above
  and made into a lake, full of large pieces of timber, which
  were precipitated all at once with surprising effect. The
  other was a dry cascade, down which two heaps of timber
  were discharged, like the launching of a ship from an
  inclined plane, the smallest of which, as I could judge from
  below, was twice the height of a man, and four times the
  length at least. The finest part of this was the prodigious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
  splashing at the bottom, which resembled, in appearance and
  sound, a line of cannonading. By way of sport, this is the
  most superb child-amusement one could conceive. We rowed
  back in the same boat, and disembarked about sunset. We
  proceeded directly to a salt-mine, without the King, where
  was to be an illumination. We all were decked out in
  miners' habits, and embarked, in little carts drawn by two
  men, down a shaft 1,800 feet long, lighted by candles all the
  way, ourselves having one each, like white penitents. At
  the end of this we were surprised by entering a large
  chamber, perhaps 200 yards round, with a gallery at the
  top; the whole was surrounded by festoons of lamps, and
  below it was a rich star of fire, which showed the depth of
  the mine off to great advantage. A band of music was
  playing, and mines were exploded at the bottom with really
  tremendous noise. Altogether, this scene pleased me more
  than any I have seen here, or perhaps anywhere.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Wednesday, August 23.&mdash;</span>
  At 5 we started in the carriage,
  with Devon's servant, for the second <i>chasse</i> (of
  chamois); we found ourselves among a long train of other
  carriages also going there. We passed through the <i>chasse</i>
  of Monday, and went about 3 miles further on foot. We
  found that of 60 chamois which had been collected in
  the toils, 40 had escaped; so the <i>chasse</i> was but of about
  an hour's duration before they were all killed. The stands
  of shooters were confined, so we were made to climb up a
  little mountain, or rather a large rock, from which we had
  an excellent view of everything. The scenery was superb
  and wild. Before, behind, and everywhere, were immense
  mountains of solid and shagged rock, 9,000 feet high above
  the sea, with nothing like vegetation but patches of stunted
  firs, which did not, even so, reach halfway up their height,
  and looked like moss. It made a contrast with the tameness
  of the <i>chasse</i>, where about 16 chamois were driven
  about and killed out of little boxes, in an enclosure of a few
  acres. It was not so fine in that respect as the deer <i>chasse</i>.
  The King asked us again to dinner, near a small house in
  the valley of the deer <i>chasse</i> (Wimbach). The table was
  put on a platform under a sycamore-tree in a glorious situation.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
  I was unexpectedly called upon to sit next to Prince
  Schwartzenberg, and always called <i>milord</i>, which probably
  was the original mistake. The whole business went off
  very satisfactorily. The King's manners are most affable,
  and made everything comfortable about him."
</p>
<p>
After this grand performance, our tourists took a ride
through a salt-mine, astride of a plank, with a man before
and behind running as fast as could be; they come finally
to daylight, and shortly afterwards to Salzburg. They travelled
the country to Lintz, and sailed down the Danube to
Vienna, where they found the police "ridiculously strict
about passports." A few days after their arrival in Vienna
they took a drive through the <i>Prater</i>, and "during the
drive we conversed on the subject of family calamities, and
on one's means of bearing them. Soon after we came home,
Lord Stewart's <i>attach</i>, Mr. Aston, called with a letter for
me from Mr. Allen, which told me of the horrible news of
my brother Bob's death in America, killed in an affray with
his first lieutenant! How strangely fulfilled were our
yesterday's prognostics. This is a sort of thing that is too
great and deep an accident to feel in the common way. I
hardly understand it at this distance: I shall though
before long. I went with Lefevre after dinner to Lord
Stewart's, where I found a German courier was to start
soon for England. I shall accompany him." This is from
the Journal; we shall now give an extract from the
Autobiography:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My first tour abroad was suddenly terminated at Vienna
  by a letter which I received to recall me home, from the
  Rev. J. Allen, now Bishop of Ely. This letter gave me notice
  of the supposed death of my brother Robert, in South
  America, who, it was reported, had been killed in an affray
  with his first lieutenant. This most strange story, for
  which there was not the slightest foundation in truth, was
  conveyed to our family in England in such a way as gained
  it entire belief, and all had been for two or three weeks in
  deep mourning and under the greatest affliction, when the
  falsehood of the report was discovered. This affliction was
  considered a sufficient cause for gathering together all the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
  members of the family who were at liberty to come home;
  and so I was desired to return immediately. I bought a
  carriage at Vienna, and, travelled for some nights and days
  without ceasing, during which I thought to try an experiment
  on how little nourishment I could subsist; and from
  a sort of curiosity to amuse myself, for I can hardly
  attribute it to a better motive, I accomplished a fast which it
  would appear a dreadful hardship to be reduced to by necessity,
  and a very small approach to which, in these times,
  would be by most persons looked on as a most unreasonable
  austerity. I passed those successive intervals of 38, 50, and
  53 hours, as I find in my journal, without touching the
  least particle of food to eat or drink; and what I took
  between the intervals was only a little tea and bread and
  butter. This matter is not worth noticing, except to show
  that, as I went through this, while travelling, which is
  rather an exhausting employment, without the least detriment
  to my health, and without a feeling of hunger almost
  all the time, it is a sad delusion for people in good health to
  fancy they need so many indulgences and relaxations to go
  through the fasts appointed by the Church.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It was when I got to Calais that I went to the English
  news-room to see further accounts in the newspapers of my
  brother's death, the report of which, though at first I had
  some suspicions it might be false, I afterwards had made up
  my mind entirely to believe. My joy was exceeding great
  at finding an explicit contradiction to it in one of the latest
  papers. I remember going on my knees to thank God, in
  the news-room, when I found myself alone, which I believe
  was the first occasion for a long, long time I had made a
  prayer of any sort, or gone on my knees, except in church-service
  time. This I never gave up entirely, and during
  this time I never gave up receiving the Sacrament explicitly,
  though I do not find that I received it all the time
  I was abroad. I did not intend to commit acts of hypocrisy,
  but must have gone on from custom and a certain
  sense of propriety, without considering that I was mocking
  God."
</p>
<p>
On his arrival at Althorp he found the family all in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
most joyous mood possible. A little passage of his Journal
gives an idea of the character of the noble family in their
relations with the tenantry:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Friday, Sept. 22.</span> Bread
  and meat given to the poor of Brington, Brampton, and
  Harleston, as a rejoicing for Bob's recovery. Three oxen
  were killed, and the effect seemed very good. They gave
  some lively cheers as they departed."
</p>
<p>
He goes to London,
and hears Henry Brougham's speech on Queen Caroline's
trial; and immediately after, he starts for Switzerland to
see his sister, Lady Georgiana Quin. We shall relate this
in his own words in the Autobiography:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I became so fond of the business of travelling that, as I
  was returning homewards, my mind was occupied constantly
  with plans for further excursions. I intended to have gone
  with Lefevre from Vienna to Dresden and Berlin on our
  way home, but I could not think of regarding this as my
  last journey. I was longing to see Greece. I had had thoughts
  of Spain, Russia, Egypt, and various indeed have been the
  fancies and inclinations which have passed through my mind.
  The regular travelling mania had its turn about this time,
  and I wonder not, by my feelings then, at so many of our
  countrymen, whom I have known myself, who have left
  England for a short excursion, and not having professional
  engagements, nor wise parents and relations, as I had, to
  control them, have become regular wanderers, and have
  spent, in travelling about, the years on the good employment
  of which, at home, depended mainly their success in after-life.
  It may be judged how truly I was possessed with this
  spirit of wandering, at the time of which I speak, by my
  remaining but one fortnight at Althorp with my family
  before I was again on wing. My sister, Lady Georgiana
  Quin&mdash;whose society had made to me one of the chief charms
  of the winter at Naples, and whose being at Naples with
  Lord George, her husband, and her children, had been the
  main inducement for my father and mother to make an
  undertaking, at their age, and with their habits, so
  extraordinary as this long journey&mdash;had left Naples during my tour
  in Sicily, and was settled at a country-house called the
  Chteau de Bethusy, near Lausanne. I proposed going to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
  see her, and to give her the full account of all that concerned
  the strange report about my brother Robert. I wonder at
  my having had my parents' consent to make another departure
  so soon, and with apparently so insufficient an object.
  I suppose they thought it reasonable to give me this liberty,
  by way of compensation for the sudden cutting-off of my
  first grand tour. This time I passed by Dieppe to Paris,
  thence by Lyons to Bethusy, where, having stayed a
  fortnight&mdash;the pleasantest, and, alas! almost the last days I had
  in my sister's company&mdash;I returned by Nancy to Paris, and
  thence through Calais to England. I reached Althorp on
  the 19th of November, 1820. And so the fancy for travelling
  soon died away, as my prospects for fresh journeys met
  with no encouragement at home; and here is an end of all
  my travellings for mere travelling's sake. When next I left
  England, it was, thank God, with thoughts and views far
  other than before."
</p>
<p>
An extract from the Journal of this time may not be
without interest:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">October 17, 1820.&mdash;</span>
  With this day's journal ends the
  third year that I have kept it. This year has been the most
  interesting and varied I have ever passed, and probably ever
  shall, for my travelling will not last long. I certainly have
  reaped advantages in some respects, and great ones. I have
  had experience in the world, and have learnt to shift for
  myself better than I could have done by any other means.
  I have, I hope, increased the confidence of my family in me;
  and, above all, I have nearly expelled that melancholy
  disposition I gained at college; but most active I feel I must
  be to prevent its return when I again remain quiet in
  England. I have still a damper to my prospects that occasionally
  overwhelms me, but I must, I trust, get over that
  too; as I have now persuaded myself on sober reflection,
  though I am sadly slow in beginning to act on the principle,
  that one quality alone is within all our reach, and that one
  object alone is worth trying for. God grant this thought
  may often occur to me. I have this year enjoyed the
  pleasures and diversions most enlivening, and which I
  always most desired; but even they are insufficient to make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
  one happy alone, though nearer to it than any others. Let us
  then look to what certainly can."
</p>
<p>
This train of thought seemed to have occupied his mind
between his leaving Paris, and returning to it again during
the last visit to his sister. There is one paragraph in the
Autobiography which refers to both; here it is, and it is the
last morsel of that interesting document that remains
unwritten in his life:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The most remarkable impression of religion which I
  remember in all this period, was in a place where it might
  have been least expected. No other than the Italian Opera
  at Paris. I passed through that city, as I have said before,
  in my last journey to Lausanne, and on my return a month
  later. Both times I went to see the opera of <i>Don Giovanni</i>,
  which was the piece then in course of representation. I
  conceived that after this journey I should give up all
  thoughts of worldly vices. I was likely to be fixed at home
  till the time of my ordination, and should assume something
  of the character of a candidate for holy orders. In short, I
  felt as if it was almost my last occasion, and I was
  entertaining, alas! some wicked devices in my mind when I
  went to this most dangerous and fascinating opera, which is
  in itself, by the subjects it represents, one of the most
  calculated to beguile a weak soul to its destruction. But
  the last scene of it represents Don Giovanni, the hero of
  the piece, seized in the midst of his licentious career by a
  troop of devils, and hurried down to hell. As I saw this
  scene, I was terrified at my own state. I knew that God,
  who knew what was within me, must look on me as one in
  the same class with such as Don Giovanni, and for once this
  holy fear of God's judgment saved me: and this holy
  warning I was to find in an opera-house at Paris."

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br>
An Interval Of Rest And Preparation For Orders.</h2>
<br>
<p>
This chapter begins with his twenty-first birthday. He
comes before us, a fine young man nearly six feet high,
graceful and handsome, of independent mien, winning manners,
and all the other attributes of gentlemanly perfection
that are calculated to make him an object of attraction.
His journal, even then, tends to show his worst side; we
find self-accusations in every page, and the round of enjoyments
broken in upon by serious correctives. For the great
problem which moralists solve so easily, and those whom
the solution concerns keep away from consideration, we will
find in his life a golden key. It is too soon yet to speak
about the special workings of Divine Grace in his soul; but,
even so far off, we can find glimmerings of the glorious sun
of his after-life. Let us look into the world, we find thousands
that really enjoy and luxuriate in gay parties, balls,
pastimes, and pleasures, without a pang of remorse, and
others with sensibilities as keen, if not keener, for the relish
of these luxuries, plunging into them with a kind of intoxicating
gusto, and coming out fagged and disgusted, when
they were perhaps thought the very soul and life of the
company. We are told of a patient dying of melancholy
who called in a doctor to prescribe for him; the prescription
of the medical man was, that he should go and hear Mr. N.,
a celebrated comic actor, for a number of nights successively,
and the remedy was guaranteed to prove infallible, for no
one could listen to him and not laugh himself to hysterics.
"Ah, my dear friend," answered the patient, "I am the
veritable Mr. N. myself." It is sometimes argued that
small minds of a feminine caste, composed of the ingredients
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
which the "Spectator" wittily discovers in the dissection of a
beau's head, can be content with frivolities, whilst a grand
intellect is only made indignant by them. We could quote
examples to bear us out in a conclusion the direct contrary
of this. How, then, can we solve the problem? Why can
some live and die in a whirl of dissipation with apparent
relish, whilst others get clogged by a few balls, and fling
worldly enjoyment to the winds on account of the very
nausea it creates? It may be considered as "going into the
sacristy" to say that those whom God chooses for great
things, He weans from pleasure by a salutary dissatisfaction?
so the point will not be insisted on. The only ordinary way
in which it can be accounted for is, that the lovers of pleasure
deafen the voice of conscience, whereas the others give
this good monitor room to speak, and occasionally lend an
ear. Whichever way we please to look upon F. Ignatius
at this period of his life, we shall find ample material for
theorizing on the unreality of worldly joys. He concludes
the first volume of his Journal with the following
considerations:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"Dec. 31.&mdash;</span>
  I have ended this year, as the last, with a
  very pleasant evening, as far as noise and fun can make it.
  But a more reasonable way would be (as I am now in my
  room, with my watch in my hand, nearly on the stroke
  of twelve) to end it in making good resolutions for the year
  to come,&mdash;which may, I hope, pass as prosperously, and
  more usefully, than the last. The new year is now commenced,
  and I recommend myself to the protection and
  guidance of Almighty Providence to bring me safely and
  well to the end of it. I now bid farewell to this journal-book,
  which is but a record of my follies, and absurdities,
  and weaknesses, to myself, who know the motive of the
  actions which are here commemorated, and of many more
  which I have done well to omit. There is no fear of my
  forgetting them, nor do I wish it. The less other men
  know about my inward thoughts, the better for me in their
  estimation."
</p>
<p>
Many of the readers of this book will feel disposed to
disagree with the last sentence. We have had his interior
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
before us, as clearly perhaps as any other man's we can
possibly call to mind, and yet there is scarcely one that must
not admire and love him as well, for the sacrifice he made
for their benefit in exposing his interior, as for the beautiful
sight that very disclosure gives them of his noble heart. It
is not very easy to write an interesting chapter about this
portion of his life; the Autobiography is run out, and the
Journal gives no incident of any great importance till we
come to the subject-matter of the next volume. Let us
string together a few of the leading events, especially such
as may be calculated to give us some idea of his mind and
occupations.
</p>
<p>
He begins the volume by writing down that he got up
rather earlier than usual, played at battledore and shuttle-cock
with Lady Georgiana Bingham, and kept up to 2,120
hits. He is disappointed then in a day's sport, and gives
this account of his evening: "I was rather bilious and
nervous to-night, and consequently would have preferred
being out of the way, but from a wrong principle, I fear,
viz., because I thought I should seem rather dull and ill-humoured.
But what if I did, to the gay people that do
not, nor wish to, know? And what if I did, to those who
do know how far it is real, my ill-humour?" It was customary,
as he told us some chapters back, for the Spencer
family to spend Christmas at Althorp, and collect many of
their immediate relatives about them during the time.
The place is beautifully disposed for every kind of enjoyment;
there are landscapes and pictures for the ladies to
draw from, fine grounds for the gentlemen to shoot over,
everything that generosity and princely goodness could
procure to make the evenings as lively and entertaining as
possible. Balls and dances were, of course, a <i>sine qua non</i>.
Let us not, however, imagine it was all dissipation at
Althorp. Lords Althorp and Lyttelton used, every Sunday
and often on week days, to read a sermon to the assembled
guests from some of the Anglican divines, and sometimes,
too, from the French, as we may see in a remark in
the first chapter. The party at Althorp this Christmas did
not go beyond three-and-twenty. George, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
the sour extract quoted above, went into the sports with
heartfelt glee occasionally, and, as a proof of this, it is
enough to say that he danced, in one night, in seven
country dances and eight sets of quadrilles. He says in one
place: "Lyttelton, Sarah (Lady Lyttelton), and I, breakfasted
together, talking of a wise resolve of Nannette's, to
pull down a house she had just finished at Richmond,
because it was not pretty enough for the inhabitants to
look at."
</p>
<p>
He goes to London as soon as the Christmas party is
broken up, where he dines chiefly at home, but is about
occasionally, seeing his old friends, and different things that
pleased his whim or his taste. One of these was "seeing the
King going in state, and the nobility as contented as if they
never said a word against him on the Queen's trial;"
another was hearing Bishop Van Mildert preach. He has
the good fortune of meeting Sir Walter Scott at his father's,
and says "We all stayed the evening listening to him
telling Scotch stories." His next evening would be, perhaps,
in the House of Lords or Commons, and all the family
seemed in a great stir to be present at the debates on the
"Catholic Question." What opinions they held about it
do not appear from the Journal; but there is nothing said
there against Catholics since he left Italy.
</p>
<p>
He begins to clear away the mist that lay between him
and the parsonage. He puts himself a little in the way of
learning something of what a clergyman could not be
respectable without. His first essays in this direction were,
to hire a "dirty Jew master" to teach him Hebrew, and to
go occasionally to Mr. Blomfield's, who was rector of
Whitechapel, to dine and talk with clerical company. The
first time he tried this is told as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I took up Fremantle, and we went together to Blomfield's
to dine. We met Dr. Lloyd, Mr. Rennel, Mr. and
Mrs. Lyall, Mr. Watkinson, Mr. Mawman, Mr. Tavel, and
one more clergyman&mdash;a proper High Church set, with
language of intolerance. I was much amused though by
observing them." So much for his first lesson in church
polity. That he was not extravagant at this time is evidenced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
by a little incident. He found himself the possessor
of a good sum, and had been, for some time, putting part
of his allowance aside until he finds himself able to pay his
brother, Lord Althorp, what he lent him to pay off his debts
in Cambridge, as early as the 7th of April. "This was a
very busy day. I first went to Althorp to offer him payment
of a large debt I owe him, but he refused it very
generously, and made me rich in a moment by so doing."
</p>
<p>
He pays off the Jew on the 25th of April, having had
his lectures from the 8th of March previous. This apparent
falling away from the spirit of his vocation, was redeemed in
a few days, by his falling half in love with some very high
lady. He crosses himself immediately for the absurdity,
and wishes she were a clergyman's daughter. This fit wears
out completely in ten days' time. Lord John Russell and
Sydney Smith dine at his father's, and he says of the latter:
"Sydney Smith is a new person on my list, and very entertaining
he is." The author of "Peter Plimley's Letters"
must certainly have been an agreeable guest. On the
15th of June he gives the following note:&mdash;"My father
and I went to see the marriage of Mr. Neville and Lady
Georgiana Bingham, in the Portuguese Catholic Chapel, in
South Street, close to Vernon's house. Dr. Poynter, the
Catholic bishop of London, performed it, and gave us a long-prosy
dissertation on the sacrament of marriage." The
scene changes now to Ryde, Isle of Wight, where the family
go to spend the summer. George occupies his time there in
riding, fishing (with no success), boating, cricketing, and
doing the tutor to a young ward of his father. He also
learnt perspective from a Mr. Vorley, and his opinion of
him is, that "he talks more nonsense than any one I know
in a given time." He remained his pupil until he "picked
his brains," which did not require much time or application
seemingly. He hears of Napoleon's death, and comments
thereon thus:&mdash;"We heard this morning of Bonaparte being
dead in St. Helena. It does not make so much noise as one
would have thought his death must eight years ago. For
one thing, it will save us 150,000 a year."
</p>
<p>
St. Swithin's Day, July 15. "It rained all morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
which is ominous. "This kept them indoors, and it was well,
for they were all in a bustle preparing for the coronation of
William IV. The countess and her maids were busy at the
laces and the freshening of faded colours, until the earl's state
robes were got ready; when he was called upon to fit them
on, that the keen glance of ladies' eyes might see if there
was a flaw or a speck to be removed. George was present at
the time, and says: "My father put on his robes, and was
looked at by a room full of ladies and gentlemen." George
himself, by the way, makes some bold efforts at grandeur,
and succeeds in getting into the Peers' quarter of Westminster
Abbey, at the coronation, "dressed in red coat,
with ruffs." After the coronation, they return to the Isle
of Wight, and George resumes his sports, with a little variation
namely, that he hears a "twaddle preacher," and receives
the Sacrament without much preparation, a proceeding
he thus defends:&mdash;"I never can be satisfied by any
motives that occur for refusing on account of short notice,
and I think that when the Office is performed with devotion
and sincerity, to the best of one's ability, it is always
profitable."
</p>
<p>
It may be objected that we do not give more numerous
extracts from the Journal; but we think it would tire the
patience of readers to be told, gravely and solemnly, such
grand events as, "George Lyttelton, Lord Lyttelton's eldest
child, got into breeches to-day." Matters kindred to this,
with the hours of dining, and names of the guests, form the
bulk of the diary.
</p>
<p>
Towards the end of this year, 1821, he finds himself alone
in Althorp, waiting for the collecting of the Christmas
party there, and muses thus:&mdash;"I wish I might go on
living as I now do, without any company and nonsense. I
have daily amusement, and, withal, get through a good deal
of reading." This last clause will make many expect that
Tillotson or Jeremy Taylor is in his hands for a great part
of the day. It may be so, but we are told in the same
page:&mdash;"In the evening I read 'Guy Mannering;' for a
novel, when once begun, enslaves me." He was very fond
of the Waverly Novels, and seems to have read them as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
they came out. He misses a hunt, through mistake, and
says; "I was annoyed to-day at the hoy I made in my
manoeuvres; but I am ashamed of being so, for it all came
from my odious vanity, and sensibility to the opinion of all
the fools I met with." On his twenty-second birthday he
makes these reflections:&mdash;"This anniversary becomes uninteresting
after passing 21. But it should be a useful annual
admonition to make the best of our short, fleeting life.
What are called the best and happiest years of life are already
past with me. God grant that I make those that remain
more profitable to others, and consequently to myself. As
to happiness, I think my temper and dispositions have prevented
my having my share to the full of youthful pleasures;
so I may look forward to the future for better circumstances:
if I can but tutor my mind into contentment
at my situation, and an engrossing wish to make my duty
the leading guide of my actions. Indolence and irresolution
are my stumbling blocks."
</p>
<p>
The new year of 1822 was danced into Althorp by a
grand ball. Three days after he had a narrow escape with
his life; he went out partridge-shooting with Lord Bingham,
and this gentleman's powder-flask took fire, and burst
in his hand. George and the attendants were nearly blown
up, and Lord Bingham was severely scorched. This he
considered the greatest danger he was ever in, and thanks
God for his escape. The impression, however, did not last
long; for he tells us, as the result of a game of cards, on the
same night:&mdash;"I did not get to sleep for a long time for
thinking over a trick at cards which E&mdash;&mdash; did. I succeeded
in discovering it." When the Christmas party is
dissolved, George's comments are: "I am sorry they are all
going, though the young damsels have caught nothing of my
heart."
</p>
<p>
There is an event now to be recorded. He becomes a
magistrate, and his first essay in court makes him think the
business very amusing. He shouts huzza! on hearing that
his brother Robert is about to come home. True, however,
to his character, of never undertaking anything unless he
knew its obligations sufficiently to be able to acquit himself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
in them to the satisfaction of his conscience, he goes to
London, and studies "Blackstone's Commentaries," to
qualify him for a proper discharge of his duties as a magistrate.
He dines, dances, goes to balls and theatres,
pays visits and bills during his stay in London, notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>
Now he begins to prepare seriously for his future profession.
Full nine months before he is to receive Orders, on
March the 12th he begins to write a sermon. That is the
point; let a man give a sermon, and he may become a
minister any day, provided he has an earl or a viscount at
his back, and a bishop who sits <i>tte  tte</i> with either in the
House of Lords, and has two or three sons whom he wishes
to put into posts of honour. The sermon is everything.
Any one can read the Service, provided he has a good voice
and distinct utterance; but the sermon&mdash;that requires
brains, views, style, and paper. How these things can be
done without we shall see further on. For the present,
poor George did not discover the secret. He could bowl
to a wicket, play cribbage, read Walter Scott, and shoot
partridges, but where was his theology? The twenty-five
lectures were buried long ago under some stone between
Cambridge and Althorp. Well, the fact of it was, he must
do something. He goes to hear the "crack" preachers of
London, and even the "twaddle" ditto. He catches up
some idea from them, borrows the book Lord Althorp reads
from on Sunday afternoons, and gets an idea of what a sermon
is like. He sets to, therefore, to write one himself,
and in six months that sermon is finished.
</p>
<p>
One could not expect him to be a bookworm just now.
Lord Palmerston is at a stag-hunt, and patronized the young
candidate. Washington Irving dines at his father's, and
George has to take notes of his "Yankee twang, sallow
complexion, and nasal sounds." He used to say to us
that one who saw Irving, and heard him speak, could
never believe he was the author of "The Traveller"
or "Bracebridge Hall," and much less of "Knickerbocker's
History of New York." Irving himself alludes to this,
when he says, somewhere, that the London people
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
"wondered that he held a quill in his hand, instead of wearing it
in his scalp-lock." He gets over all this after the Ryde
recreation, and the hunting at Wiseton, when, towards the
end of September this year, he bids farewell to his military
life as a cornet in the Yeomanry of Northampton. This is
as a preparation for his Orders; but they come upon him still
unexpectedly when he receives a letter from the Bishop of
Peterborough, on the 5th of October, to signify that he would
have Ordination on the 22nd of December following. He
writes to the Diocesan Examiner to ask what books he is to
read, and how he is to prepare, and that gentleman graciously
tells him that he need not trouble himself; that he
knows, from the respectability of his family, he must be already
quite prepared. [Footnote 5] George is contented for the present,
but he has an eye to the future; he borrows, therefore, some
twelve of the Wimbledon clergyman's best sermons, and
says "that will set me up for a start." He then goes on
retreat about the 16th of December, and his day is divided
into four principal parts, making allowances for dinner and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
sleep, consisting of shooting, cribbage, whist, and sermon
writing or copying, as the case might be. On the 18th, two
days before, he adds one more spiritual exercise to his usual
ones; he reads a novel. The next day he goes off to Peterborough,
and dines with the Dean and his wife, "who are
to feed him" whilst he is there. His examination is gone
through&mdash;one of the Thirty-nine Articles to be translated
into Latin, and he has an <i>expos</i>, with illustrations, on the
nature of mesmerism, for the rest of the terrible ordeal.
This passed successfully, he comes home to the Dean's house,
bids good night to the <i>materfamilias</i>, and collects his spirits
for the great occasion. He is wrapt in sublime ecstacy, and
bursts forth into the following exclamation in his Journal:
"I am 22 years old, and not yet engaged to be married!"
</p>
<p class="footnote">
[Footnote 5:
Here is a copy of the letter with which he was favoured from
that dignitary:<br>
  "Yarmouth, Norfolk, October 12.
<br><br>
  "My Dear Sir,<br>
  "I am sorry my absence from Cambridge may have made me
  appear neglectful in answering your letter, but I have some
  consolation in thinking that you will not have suffered by the delay. As
  far as I am concerned, in my character of examiner, it is impossible
  that I could ever entertain any idea of subjecting a gentleman with
  whose talents and good qualities I am so well acquainted as I am
  with yours, to any examination except one as a matter of form, for
  which a verse in the Greek Testament, and an Article of the Church
  of England returned into Latin will be amply sufficient. With
  regard to the doctrinal part of the examination, that is taken by the
  Bishop himself, but it is confined entirely to the prepared questions,
  which are a test of opinions, not of scholarship. This information,
  then, will, I trust, be satisfactorily, and will leave you at liberty to
  pursue your theological studies in that course which you yourself
  prefer, and which I am confident will be a good one. I really am
  unable to say whether the Bishop of Peterbro' requires a certificate
  of the Divinity Lectures or not, but I know that he does not in all
  cases make it a <i>sine qua non</i>; at any rate, I think you had better
  send for it, as it will give the professor but very little trouble to
  forward it under cover to your father.

<br>



<h2>CHAPTER I.<br>
He Is Ordained, And Enters On His Clerical Duties.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The Establishment retains in her written formularies
a great deal of what looks very like
Catholic. She has an attempt at a profession
of faith; a kind of a sacramental rite, as a
substitute for the Mass; a mode of visiting the
sick, a marriage service, baptismal service, burial service,
and an ordinal; even something like the Sacrament of
Penance can be gleaned from two or three clauses in the
Book of Common Prayer. How much of sacramental
power there may be in those several ordinances is very
easily determined; we admit none whatever in any except
baptism&mdash;the judicial voice of the Establishment leaves
its efficacy an open question&mdash;and matrimony. Of late,
some amongst them have felt their want of sacramental
wealth so keenly, that they would fain persuade themselves
the shells of Catholic rites, which the Reformers retained,
were filled with sacramental substance. To give this theory
some show of plausibility, they claimed valid orders. Pamphlets
and books have been written on two sides of this
question until there seems scarcely any more to be said
upon it, so we just mention what is the Catholic opinion on
the validity of Anglican orders.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
<p>
With what Protestants think of them we have no immediate
concern; nor would it be an easy matter to extract
anything definite from the multitude and contrariety of
opinions on this one point.
</p>
<p>
We hold them to be simply <i>null</i>; they do not even come
up to doubt; for if the Archbishop of Canterbury became a
Catholic to-morrow, and wished to exercise any ministry, he
would be obliged to receive all the orders from the first
tonsure upwards, absolutely, and without even an implied
condition. This has always been the practice: and, the
Church's acting thus, at the period which is now involved
in obscurity, is the best <i>de facto</i> argument that the orders
of the Establishment were then, as they are now, a human
designation, and nothing more. There is nothing sacramental
in Anglican orders, and there never was, since
England broke away from the Church, and, consistently
enough, orders were expunged from the Protestant catalogue
of sacraments in the very infancy of the Reformation.
They still keep up a semblance of orders: they have what
they call the diaconate, the priesthood, and the consecration
of bishops. A deacon is ordained much in the same way
as our own deacons, and he can perform all the duties of
the parish, with the exception of the Communion Service.
</p>
<p>
We see a man marked out by an Anglican bishop for
ecclesiastical duties, without any sacramental grace, spiritual
character, or jurisdiction, for no less a work than the care
of immortal souls. Let us see now what instruments he has
wherewith to accomplish this.
</p>
<p>
He had once two Sacraments&mdash;the Lord's Supper and
Baptism; the former, Catholics know to be an empty ceremony,
and perhaps it would nearly be a Protestant heresy
to say it was much more. Baptism they had as Turks have,
and as every lay man and woman in the world, who performs
the rite properly, has. Now their judicial decisions do not
consider it worth the having; so, as far as in themselves
lies, they have tried to deprive themselves of it. The practical
means of sanctification a minister has to use are
chiefly four: prayer, preaching, visiting, and reading. The
reading part may evidently be performed as well, if not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
better sometimes, by a layman. The visiting is often better
done by the clergyman's wife or daughter than by himself,
for, in attention to sickness and sweet words of consolation,
the female gifts seem the more effectual. All that remains
to him, peculiarly for his own, is the preaching, and the
respectability of character his own conduct and regard for
his position may give him. His power is altogether personal,
and if he be an indifferent preacher or a careless
liver, he loses all.
</p>
<p>
Whether candidates for orders, or even the ordained of
the Anglican Establishment, take this view of their position,
one cannot be sure; but, from the acts and words of Mr.
Spencer, we can form a tolerable conjecture of what he
thought and intended when he took deacon's orders from
Dr. Marsh, Protestant Bishop of Peterborough, on the
22nd December, 1822. He makes no preparation whatever,
nor does he seem to fancy that it is an action that
requires any. He gives an account of the ordination,
which he was pleased to call, "talking of business," when
making his arrangements for it, a few pages back in the
Journal, and, as a piece of business, it is gone through by
him. We transcribe his own words:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Sunday, Dec. 22.</span>
  I breakfasted with Mr. Gibbs and Mr.
  Gregory at the inn (Peterborough) at 8. At 9, two others
  of the candidates, Mr. Pearson and Mr. Witherall, joined
  us, and we went to the palace, from whence the bishop led
  us into the church, when we were ordained. The service
  took an hour, including the Sacrament which he gave us.
  I commenced my church-reading then by reading the
  gospel in the service. I went (a clergyman) to the deanery.
  At 11 we went all together from the palace to church,
  when Mr. Parsons preached a good long sermon&mdash;at us
  very palpably. We then went to a cold collation at the
  palace till evening church, which we attended. After that
  we received our letters of orders and licences, and paid our
  fees."
</p>
<p>
It may be said that this is a very nice little account
squeezed into a journal, and one could not expect enthusiastic
bursts about the gift of the spirit and the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
the Church, in a book allotted to the bare recording of
events. So be it. But there are enthusiastic exclamations
about less important things in that same little book, and if
ordination looked anything to Mr. Spencer than a condition
<i>sine qua</i> of his getting fixed in his future position, he would
have noted it. The absence of deep religious feeling at this
period of his life may account in a great measure for this
coolness; but perhaps the not believing there was anything
sacramental in the rite itself may give a more satisfactory
explanation. To wind up the matter in a few words&mdash;he
said grace for the family at dinner that evening, and then
read his <i>novel</i> quietly in his room, because the day was not
favourable for any field sport.
</p>
<p>
These few explanations were deemed necessary for appreciating
the tenor of his life from this moment forward. It
will run counter to all anticipated results in the direction
of excellence, and will even go far beyond what its first
evidences would warrant one to expect. He looked his
position in the face at the very outset: he saw that he had
souls to look after, and he knew that he could not do that
without a course of consistent conduct beseeming his character.
For the first few days things went on much as of
old. The family were still spending the winter in Althorp,
and he joined in all the pastimes by which they whiled
away the short days and cheered the long nights. It was
requisite, however, that the cousins and nearer relations,
should see and hear George in his new position, if it were
only to have something to talk about when they came to
London. Accordingly, he assisted in the Communion Service
on Christmas Day by administering "the cup," first
to his father, and then to others. He did not "think the
thing so formidable," and it wore off the apprehension he
had of appearing in public sufficient for him to give his first
sermon on Sunday, Dec. 29. It was on the Birth of Christ,
and he says, "Althorp and Duncannon were my audience;"
whether they were a whole or a part of the audience, it is
not easy at this distance to discover.
</p>
<p>
He might be now considered fairly launched into his new
element. The rector of Great Brington, a Mr. Vigoreux,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
was away on the continent, and the parish was left to the
care of the young curate. He had three or four villages,
numbering about 800, in his parish, some distance apart,
and he lived in Althorp himself. On the 1st of January,
1823, he sets vigorously to work, and, regardless of wind or
weather, walks out from breakfast until about six o'clock
every day, visiting the people. After the first few days he
gets quite interested in the work, and is cheered on by his
success in making up differences, consoling the dying, and
assisting the poor. Two notes from the Journal will illustrate
how he felt with regard to this visiting:&mdash;"Feb. 10.
Went to Little Brington, where I paid 20 visits among the
poor. Feb. 11. Visited 15 or 20 houses; this work is
very amusing to me now. I hope I shall never get tired of
it, or be disgusted by bad success to my lectures."
</p>
<p>
The principal work he tries to accomplish by his visits is,
the supplying those deficiencies he finds in the people with
regard to what he conceived to be sacraments. His very
first round through the parish showed him how few were
up to the mark of good Christians. Many Dissenters chose
to dispute his right to lecture them, and were not slow to
produce clauses of protection for themselves; and his having
"a discussion with one roaring Methodist," did not lessen
the difficulty of making them tractable sheep. Discussions
proved to be a means of widening the breach, and simple
kindness left things where they stood. Something positive
he must mark out as a duty to his flock, and then exhort
them to it. Instinct led him to the sacraments. He found
great numbers unbaptized, believing in a spiritual regeneration,
and scoffing at the idea of heavenly virtue being in
a drop of water; he found more still, and these among the
baptized, who had as little love for the Lord's Supper as he
had himself once. Now these could very easily be managed
by exhorting them to read the Bible, lending them a copy
if they had not one, recommending family prayers, and
kindness and justice towards all men. Mr. Spencer thought
otherwise. He began with baptism, and within the first
fortnight of his clerical life he baptized the nine children of
a blacksmith. This was a good beginning, and encouraged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
him to persevere, but he did not find many so malleable as
the offspring of this son of Tubal Cain.
</p>
<p>
In the next sacramental duty he did not see his way so
clearly as in the first. In the Church of England, the
<i>Sacrament</i>, as it is emphatically called, must be administered
three times a year, may be once a month, and cannot be
unless there be a number of communicants. Giving the
<i>Sacrament</i> once a week is considered very High Church,
and to give it every morning is going a little too far.
Superstitious reverence and indifference keep the majority
away from this rite, and few come, except they get a monomonia
for manifesting their godliness in that special direction.
This fact will account for Mr. Spencer's hesitation,
when he took to Christianizing his flock by making them
approach the Sacrament. He makes many promise to come,
and gets a neighbouring clergyman to administer it in their
own houses to some decrepid old people, who could not
come to church. He preaches on this, and "hopes he has
not been wrong;" he discusses the propriety of his proceedings
with his older brethren in the ministry. The result
seems to confirm him in his ideas, and he preaches a second
time, and gives appendices to his sermon in every visit,
about going to the Lord's Supper. He still "hopes he is
not wrong." He works very hard at this point, however,
and on the first Easter Sunday of his ministry, he gives
God thanks and prays against pride, at having 130 communicants.
There was another little incident on the same
day as a set off to his success in beating up the parish;
when he opens the sermon-cover from which he used to
read his MS., he finds he had put the wrong sermon there,
and had to preach extempore the sermon he intended to
have read: of course, it was not to his satisfaction, though
the people scarcely knew the difference.
</p>
<p>
One sad event cast a cloud over the beginning of his
clerical life: the sister he loved so much, and whose company
and conversation he thought more than an equivalent
for the gayest party, Lady Georgiana Quin, died in London.
He was very much afflicted by it, and even in after-life he
would be deeply moved when speaking of this sister. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
did not delay long in London, but came home in a day or
two after the funeral.
</p>
<p>
Excepting this short interval, his time was spent at
home in the most ardent fulfilment of the duties his fervour
imposed upon him. Not only did he go about from house
to house, but he would spare a day or two, in each week,
when he went into Northampton for the sessions, and
visit the neighbouring clergy. It was his custom to discuss
points of duty with them; to invite them to Althorp,
and spend evenings in clerical conversation. He accompanied
them on their visits to the sick and other parochial
employments, to learn, by a comparison of the different
ways of each, which would probably be best for himself.
He reads such books as the "Clergyman's Instructor," and
other books of divinity and sermons; he never fails to
write a sermon every week, to catechise the children on a
Sunday, visit the schools, and try to make every one as
faithful in the discharge of their duties as he was in his
own. About Easter some members of his family came to
Althorp, and he relaxes a little for their sakes, and freely
joins them in all his former amusements; not, however,
omitting any of his visits, especially to the sick and dying.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
<br>


<h2>CHAPTER II.<br>
He Mends Some Of His Ways.</h2>
<br>
<p>
About the middle of April he came to London for three
weeks' holidays. He calls it "a smoky odious place,"
and says that entering it makes him "miserable." He is
soon immersed in the customs of his society in the metropolis,
and his feeling of uneasiness wears off. His little
experience in parish work brings a great many things to
his knowledge, of which he had not the slightest idea before.
He is at a great loss, also, how to meet the difficulties he
encounters, and doubts whether his proceedings in what he
considered his duty have been quite right. Dr. Blomfield
had always been a kind of spiritual director to Mr. Spencer:
to him he goes now for a thorough investigation of his
principles and even doctrines. Extempore praying was a
thing Dr. Blomfield never liked, and its adoption by Mr.
Spencer shows a leaning to Evangelical if not Methodistic
spirituality. Whether it was this point, or another of the
many things upon which clergymen of the Establishment
agree to differ, that they discussed, we cannot say; but the
result was far from consoling to either. He says: "I
want some setting to rights in point of orthodoxy I find.
I only hope that my decision in regard to my conduct may
not be influenced by ambition or worldliness on the one
hand, nor by spiritual pride on the other." Here may be
seen that real sincerity and disinterestedness which guided
his every step through life. If we analyze the sentence, it
looks as if the arguments of his adviser are taken in part
from the sources which Mr. Spencer hopes will not influence
his decision; and this conclusion is borne out by a
letter which will be given further on, when his confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
in the Church of England became thoroughly shaken. It
must not be supposed from this that Dr. Blomfield was
guided himself by these motives, though hints to that effect
were often rife in his lifetime; but it is natural enough that
the doctor should propose family considerations among his
other arguments, especially if he thought those not quite
persuasive.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spencer goes to the theatre, and it was the last time
in his life. His account of how that change was wrought
in him, gives us one of those peculiar instances in which
ridicule proved to be more powerful than logic or decorum.
He attended Drury Lane Theatre with one or two friends,
and in some part of the performance a parson was fearfully
caricatured, and drew bursts of laughter and applause from
the audience. This touched him sorely; eyes were pointed
towards him; his friends laughed the more, in proportion to
the efforts considerations for him made them use, in suppressing
their feelings. He went forth from the theatre
thoroughly vexed, and vowed he would never go to a
theatre again. The Journal does not give a solitary instance
in which this resolve was deviated from afterwards.
This incident had also the effect of making him consider the
propriety of several other unclerical pursuits, which he
followed, as much since his ordination as he did before. It
was not, however, till towards the end of this year that he
began to retrench them, and a little of the same power of
ridicule came to his assistance then also.
</p>
<p>
His great concern was the union of all the sects in his
parish. He knew very well that our Lord gave but one
system of Christianity, and that <i>yea</i> and <i>no</i> upon any
important point could not proceed from His lips or be parts of
His doctrine. He thought conciliatory measures the best
to effect his purpose, and he even adopted some of the
ways of Dissenters in order to be all to all towards them.
On this he seems to have been lectured by Dr. Blomfield
with some profit, for, on his return home, he says: "Whit-Sunday.
I gave a strong sermon against the Dissenters,
founded on Whit-Sunday," In a few days he pays "an
unsatisfactory visit" to one family, and says: "They are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
the hardest schismatics I've got; children unbaptized, &amp;c."
This seems High Church language, and his feeling of opposition
to Evangelicals, which finds expression in a few places,
now makes one suppose he was "a proper High Church
man." He labours hard for several weeks to prepare
children for confirmation. He has 80 of them ready, and
was so pleased with the whole affair, that he moved the
printing of the bishop's charge, as he proposed his lordship's
health in a speech after the dinner. The Sunday
after he goes round to every house, and gives final admonitions
to those on whom the bishop imposed hands a few
days before.
</p>
<p>
To help him in his incipient dislike of Methodism he has
a very curious conversation with a great "professor" of
that persuasion. This was an old woman whom he was in
the habit of visiting whenever he made his rounds where
she lived. On his entrance, they both knelt down and
prayed alternately for some time, each, out loud and
extempore, for the edification of the other. When this
rubric was carried out, they talked at full length and
breadth on the unconverted and the elect, with sundries
other kindred subjects, and this he used to style "comfortable
conversation." Sometimes the tone of conversation
would vary, and once it ran upon the line of self-accusation.
The old lady very humbly accused herself of a great many
faults in general, and signified to Mr. Spencer that she
would be very much obliged to any one who would point
out her particular faults, and help her in correcting them.
Emboldened by this, he ventured, after a long preamble, to
suggest that there was one thing he would like to see corrected
in her, as it seemed to be the only speck on the
lustre of her godliness. "What is that?" asked she,
rather curiously and impatiently. "Well, it is that you
are rather fond of contradicting people." "No, I am not,"
was the reply. "You have just contradicted me now."
"No, I haven't." "Well, you have repeated the same
fault." "I've done no such thing," was the petulant
rejoinder. Of course, he saw it was useless to proceed
further, and his visits became fewer for some time. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
anecdote he used to relate with peculiar tact and a most
graphic imitation of the old lady's manner.
</p>
<p>
Before giving his own account of the rise and fall of his
High Church notions, it may be well to mention another
incident that occurred about this time, towards the end of
1823. He determines to give up shooting and dancing.
He told an anecdote about how the first of these sports fell
into disfavour with him. There was a shooting party in
Althorp on a certain day, and George was in the very thick
of it. So anxious was he to distinguish himself in bringing
down game, that he would run to take position for a shot
with his double-barrel gun loaded, and a cartridge stuck in
either corner of his mouth, ready for action, so as not to
lose a minute in charging. He did great execution that
day, and bagged probably more braces than any other.
In the evening one of the company showed great anxiety to
get possession of something, and eventually succeeded;
whereupon, one present said, with a waggish look at George,
"You've made a parson's shot at it." This struck him very
forcibly, and suggested the resolution, which he finally
came to and kept, of giving up shooting. There is no particular
anecdote about his abstinence from dancing, we only
know that at this time he refuses to go to a ball, makes his
pastoral visits instead, and declares that he feels far more
comfortable after this than when he has been "pleasuring."
</p>
<p>
The following is taken from a letter published by Father
Ignatius in the <i>Catholic Standard</i> in December, 1853:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  ... "When I was ordained deacon in the Church of
  England at Christmas, 1822, I had, I may say, all my
  religious ideas and principles to form. I do not so well
  know how far this is a common case now. I have reason
  to think it was a very common one then. My mind was
  possessed with a decided intention of doing good, and I was
  delighted with the calling and life of a clergyman; but
  my ideas were very vague indeed as to what a clergyman
  was meant for or had to do. Very naturally, however, on
  becoming acquainted with my parishioners, among whom
  the Wesleyan Methodists, the Baptists, and the Independents
  had been gaining ground for some time previously, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
  concluded that I had to oppose their progress, and to draw
  back those who had joined them. This disposition in me
  was highly gratifying to some of the elder clergy in my
  neighbourhood, who came to make acquaintance with me as
  a new neighbour, especially to one old man, an ardent lover
  of High Church principles, who, to confirm me in them, gave
  me a book to read entitled 'Daubeny's Guide to the Church,'
  in which the divine authority of the Church, the importance
  of Apostolical succession, of episcopal government, the
  evil and sin of schism, and other ecclesiastical principles,
  were most lucidly and learnedly demonstrated. So I
  thought then; and, as far as my recollection goes, I should
  say now that I thought rightly. I was exceedingly captivated
  by these principles, which were to me quite new, and
  I found myself now ready to carry on my arguments with
  dissenters as a warrior armed; whereas in the beginning I
  had nothing but zeal in my cause to help me. I did not
  gain upon them; but this new light was so bright in my
  own mind, that I had no doubt of prevailing in time. But
  there was one weak point in the system I was defending
  which I had overlooked. It was after a time pointed out
  to me, and my fabric of High Churchism fell flat at once,
  like a child's castle of cards.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I was at this time living at Althorp, my father's principal
  residence in the country, serving as a curate to the
  parish to which it was attached, though the park itself is
  extra-parochial. Among the visitors who resorted there,
  was one of the most distinguished scholars of the day, to
  whom, as to many more of the Anglican Church, I owe a
  debt of gratitude for the interest which he took in me, and
  to the help I actually received from him in the course of
  inquiry, which has happily terminated in the haven of the
  true Church. I should like to make a grateful and honourable
  mention of his name, but as this has been found
  fault with, I forbear. I was one day explaining to him
  with earnestness the line of argument which I was pursuing
  with dissenters, and my hopes from it; I suppose I expected
  encouragement, such as I had received from many
  others. But he simply and candidly said, 'These would be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
 very convenient doctrines, if we could make use of them,
  but they are available only for Roman Catholics; they will
  not serve us.' I saw in a moment the truth of his remark,
  and his character and position gave it additional weight.
  I did not answer him; but as a soldier who has received
  what he feels to be a mortal wound, will suddenly stand
  still, and then quietly retire out of the <i>mle</i>, and seek a
  quiet spot to die in, so I went away with my High Churchism
  mortally wounded in the very prime of its vigour and
  youth, to die for ever to the character of an Anglican High
  Churchman. Why did not this open my eyes, you will say,
  to the truth of Catholicity? I answer, simply because my
  early prejudices were too strong. The unanswerable
  remark of my friend was like a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of
  all High Church ideas. If they were true, the Catholic
  would be so: <i>which is absurd</i>, as I remember Euclid would
  say. 'Therefore,' &amp;c. The grand support of the High
  Church system, church authority, having been thus overthrown,
  it was an easy though gradual work to get out of
  my mind all its minor details and accompaniments, one
  after another; such as regard for holy places, for holy days,
  for consecrated persons, for ecclesiastical writers; finally,
  almost all definite dogmatic notions. It would seem that
  all was slipping away, when, coming to the conviction of
  the truth of Catholicity some years after, it was with extraordinary
  delight I found myself picking up again the shattered
  dispersed pieces of the beautiful fabric, and placing
  them now in better order on the right foundation, solid and
  firm, no longer exposed to such a catastrophe as had upset
  my card-castle of Anglican churchmanship. This little
  passage in my ancient religious history is so sweetly interesting
  to me in the remembrance, that I have looked into
  an old diary which I used to keep at the time, to make out
  the dates, and I find by this that the duration of my High
  Church ideas was shorter than I should have imagined; but
  it was a period crowded with new, bright ideas, and naturally
  seems longer than it is. I will, to please myself,
  perhaps, more than my readers, give the dates. I note
  that, Dec. 24, 1823, the great scholar of whom I have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
  spoken came to Althorp; Jan. 23, 1824, he goes away.
  This was his last visit, for he died the summer following, as
  I find it was on the 28th of June, 1824, that, in passing by
  Oxford with my eldest brother, we called at the Hall of
  which he was superior, to inquire how he was. He was
  sick&mdash;then on his death-bed." [Footnote 6]
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 6: The name of the gentleman referred to
  above was Dr. Elmesly.]
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br>
He Receives Further Orders.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The complete levelling of his church principles left him at a
loss which way to turn. The divided state of his parish,
and the number of sects, seemed to be perpetually harassing
his mind. He set about converting them by other ways
than exhibiting his "card-castle;" he tried to open the
doors of the Establishment as wide as he could, so as to
admit if possible all classes of religionists to her communion.
Of a conversation upon this point with Lord Lyttelton, he
says, "In the evening I had a walk with Lyttelton, and
was filled with scruples about the Athanasian Creed by him
unintentionally. I had a great war with my conscience in
the evening, at bed-time." These scruples slept for some time
on account of a soporific which Dr. Blomfield administered
to him; but they arose again, and were not settled till he
became a Catholic. Various discussions procure him "lights
about the Methodist practice," and "distressing thoughts;"
so he gives up that field of working now for another.
</p>
<p>
This other field was showing good example of the different
works of mercy, and he even tries Catholic ascetism. He
takes such an interest in the poor of his parish that he goes
to the hospitals, attends dissecting-rooms, and assists at a
dispensary until he learns enough about medicine to enable
him to make prescriptions for the sick poor. He spends
evenings in making pills, and one day when a poor man
broke his thigh, Mr. Spencer went and set it for him, and it
was so well done that they did not change it when he was
brought to the infirmary. The exertion this cost him nearly
made him faint.
</p>
<p>
The next thing he notes is, "I read a most persuasive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
sermon of Beveridge's about fasting; I examined the question
in other books, and by God's grace I am resolved no
longer to disregard that duty." He applied for advice about
fasting, as was his invariable practice when he took up any
idea out of the ordinary line. He went to a neighbouring
clergyman, whom he considered well versed in the matter,
and, though this gentleman discourages the practice, Mr.
Spencer adopts it notwithstanding, since his arguments are
too weak. These are the principal events out of his ordinary
work, except his giving up card-playing, from the beginning
of the year 1824 until the 12th of June, when we find
him again in Peterborough, on the eve of receiving priest's
orders.
</p>
<p>
The demolition of his High Church notions, as well as the
tone of mind in which he received the former orders, might
lead one to anticipate that he received these second orders
somewhat after the fashion of a new step in the army. But
it was quite the contrary. His notions of orders were
higher; he looked upon this step as an important one, and
he tells us, some days before, "I walked to-day in The
Wilderness at Althorp, ruminating on my approaching ordination."
He also read the Ordination Service over and over, a
good many times. On the evening before the ordination,
whilst the Bishop and various clergymen, and their ladies,
with whom he dines, candidates included, amuse themselves
with a game of whist, Mr. Spencer refuses to play. We can
contrast his reflections now with those used on a similar
occasion a year and a half ago:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
<span class="quotehead">"Trinity Sunday, June 13.&mdash;</span>
A beautiful day. I was awake from six, and thought a
great deal of my intended step to-day. At 11 we all attended
the Bishop to church, and the prayers, ordination, and sacrament
were performed all moat satisfactorily to me. I am
now bound by the awful tie of priesthood; and most solemnly,
at the time, did I devote myself to the service of my Master.
May the impression never fade away!"
</p>
<p>
Shortly before this he heard of Dr. Blomfield's promotion
to the see of Chester, who, in answer to his letter of
congratulation, offered him the office of chaplain. He accepted
it, in a long letter to his old tutor, immediately he returned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
from Peterborough. Up to this time Mr. Spencer had been
reading the Anglican divines,&mdash;Tomline, Jeremy Taylor,
Wheatley, Bull, Hooker, &amp;c.; now he begins to read the
Fathers of the Church. The first he takes up is St. John
Chrysostom <i>On the Priesthood</i>. His opinion upon some of
the doctrines he met with there is nicely told in the letter
to the <i>Catholic Standard</i>, from which the passage in the last
chapter has been quoted.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I had to make a long journey with my brother, in his
  carriage, on that long day, June 28, from Althorp, near
  Northampton, to Southampton. It was before the epoch of
  railroads; and I see we started at half-past three. I was
  seeking a book to occupy me during this long journey (N.B.
  no Breviary to recite in those days), and, in the library at
  Althorp, I hit upon a copy, in Greek, of St. John Chrysostom
  on the Priesthood. Nothing better. I had heard this
  work highly praised, and I hoped to find some animating
  matter for the exercise of my calling as a clergyman. I was
  not disappointed in this hope; but when I came to what
  the saint says about the holy Eucharist, as, of course, the
  grand circumstance which exalts the Christian priest, I was
  overcome with surprise. I read, and read it again. Is it
  possible! I thought to myself. Why, this is manifest
  popery. He certainly must have believed in the Real
  Presence. I had no idea that popish errors had commenced
  so soon; yes, and gained deep root, too; for I saw that he
  wrote as of a doctrine about which he expected no contradiction.
  What was my conclusion here? you will ask.
  Why, simply this&mdash;<i>the Saint has erred</i>; otherwise this
  capital tenet of popery is true&mdash;<i>which is absurd</i>. I brought
  in my Euclid here, as on the previous 31st of December. I
  see that on the following day I was in the cabin of the
  vessel in which we crossed to the Isle of Wight, reading
  <i>Jeremy Taylor's Worthy Communicant</i>. St. John Chrysostom,
  I have no doubt, had been thrown overboard, not into
  the sea&mdash;which was making me then rather sick&mdash;as the
  volume was not my own to dispose of thus; but he had
  been thrown overboard with a whole multitude of Saints
  and Fathers besides, convicted with him, and condemned for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
  popish errors, into the black gulph of the dark ages; or
  rather, I had, by an act of my judgment, extended the borders
  of that gulph several centuries back, as the Regent's
  Canal Company are doing with their reservoir near our
  house, by Act of Parliament, over some of our land, so as to
  flood him and his contemporaries, and, of course, all after
  them till Luther rose to set up a dyke and save on dry land
  those who had courage to step out on the land of Gospel
  light which he first had re-discovered. I soon came to look
  on our English Reformers of the Church of England as the
  greatest and most enlightened men since the time of the
  Apostles."
</p>
<p>
He does not give up his asceticism, though he feels the
pain of it; and well he might, for he would sometimes eat
nothing until six o'clock in the evening, and be all the day
going through his parish, or writing sermons if the day were
wet. He says in the journal of one of those days: "A fasting
day till dinner made me very miserable, and makes me
doubt the excellency of this means .... dinner did
me good." He improves upon the fasting, however, by
adding another day every week, when he finds that it really
helps him to eradicate his passions and raise up his mind to
heaven. The bodily pain consequent on want of food was
not the only thing Mr. Spencer had to endure from his fasting.
It was a practice that had a popish air about it; his
friends and members of his family grew indignant that he
should be making himself peculiar. He had to bear the
brunt of all their remarks; he did so willingly, and would
sit down to the family breakfast to feed on their rebukes
and send his portion down untasted, whilst the rest took
their meal. He also reads Thomas-a-Kempis's "Imitation of
Christ," and we see evidences of that remarkable spirit for
which he was afterwards distinguished&mdash;thanking God for
everything. He becomes a secretary to the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge: that institution was a
favourite of Dr. Blomfield's, and he may have induced Mr.
Spencer to patronize it. When Mr. Spencer saw how well
it worked in its department, he thought of a scheme for
improvising something of his own. He does not give particulars
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
of what it was; but he submitted it to his Bishop, who
"threw cold water on it," and Mr. Spencer simply thanks God
for being thwarted. He is completely wrapped up in his
clerical duties, so much so that he does not give the full
time to his summer vacation in Ryde; he is always impatient
to get back to his parish when some pressing business
requires him to leave it; and even, while away, he is perpetually
visiting clergymen, and talking upon matters
belonging to his office. He seems though, ever since the
destruction of his High Church principles, to be getting
every day more Evangelical in his words and actions.

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br>
Mr. Spencer Becomes Rector Of Brington.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Mr. Vigoreux, Rector of Brington, sent in his resignation
of the living to the Bishop towards the close of the
year 1824. The letters which are found among Father
Ignatius's papers show this transaction to have been very
creditable to the Spencer family. The old rector was on
the continent,&mdash;he seems to have been very much in debt
to Lord Spencer, and upon his resigning his living, Lord
Spencer not only cancelled the debt, but made him so far
independent for life, that the old clergyman, in sheer gratitude,
ordered 7. 10s. to be distributed every year among
the poor of the parish, whilst he lived. George was transported
with delight at the news, which was given him by a
lawyer in Northampton, on the 8th November in this year,
that Mr. Vigoreux had resigned. Mr. Spencer is full of
his secret, and he and a brother clergyman have a very
pleasant evening in telling "secrets" to each other&mdash;George
about the rectorship, his friend about his intended marriage.
Things go on quietly now until the usual Christmas assemblage
of the family at Althorp, and George's reflection on
his birthday is this: "That my life past, in the main, has
been mis-spent, wasted, and worse than wasted. Last year
I have become confirmed in the first of all professions, and
I truly desire that I may grow riper and stronger in my
office." For a while he resists the temptation to join in the
sports of the young gentlemen at Althorp; at length he
gives in; he plays a few rubbers at whist in compliment to
his father, and thanks God that he plays worse and worse
every day. He also takes a few shots; but finding his old
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
eagerness returning, he throws up the gun at once, and goes
to visit the sick and the poor.
</p>
<p>
On the 12th January he is presented by his father with
the living of Brington, is instituted by the Bishop two days
after, and inducted by a neighbouring clergyman on the
20th of the same month. He is now in possession of a good
income, can afford to pay a curate to do his drudgery, and
might follow the example of non-residence which was then
so common; but he does nothing of the kind. A fat parsonage
does not come to him with an arm-chair or a sofa,
and invite him to sit down and take his rest. He considers
now that the weight of the charge obliges him to redouble
his labours; he continues to write his sermons twice over,
and never misses to have one for every Sunday. It was his
custom to give, what he called a lecture, on Sunday evenings,
&mdash;he now gives a full sermon; he also increases the days of
attendance in church as far as he can, for we find him beating
up for an attendance on Ash-Wednesday; and this he
calls an innovation. He gets a little keener in the spirit of
asceticism just now, for he tries to conceal his austerities;
and on a day he fasted till six he says: "I wish I could
root out that devil of ambition and vain-glory." Probably
it was about this time that the incident happened he used
often to relate to his religious brethren in after-life. One
day he thought to conceal his fast; but the housekeeper
brought up the toast for breakfast, and if he sent it down
untouched she would have discovered his abstinence; he
put it in the cupboard and locked it up; by-and-by the
odour it emitted perfumed the whole place, to the no small
astonishment of the housemaid. The end of it was, that
every one discovered what he tried to conceal even from
one.
</p>
<p>
We find a thorough absorption of his energies in the work
of his ministry apparent in every page of his journal, as also
from the testimony of those who knew him at that period.
One little remark will throw light upon his interior:&mdash;"My
dear Lyttelton,&mdash;Sal and the children went away at 6. I
heard the sad departing wheels out of bed. Thank God I
have heretofore found happiness in my solitude, and shall do
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
so again, I trust. His word, and the way of His Commandments,
they are my joy. May I grow in the knowledge
and practice of them, and I desire no more for this world."
Another instance of his devotion to his ministry may be
seen in the following:&mdash;"Tuesday, March 22.&mdash;Rose (a
neighbouring clergyman) and I began talking about 8, and
hardly ceased till 12 at night. Our subject was religion
and the Church, chiefly."
</p>
<p>
What beautiful material was there in this excellent clergyman!
and had he been where his spirit would be understood,
or where one knew how to direct him, what might he
not become? He found himself in a Church where spirituality
and asceticism are exotics, and cannot thrive, notwithstanding
that the Scriptures are so emphatic in exhorting
us to practise them. Then, if he took them up, he knew
not how far to go, or at what point to restrain himself. He
had no manuals, no guides; but vague attempts at fulsome
piety written for fellow-workmen, who differed with him
on the very first principles of faith. He was, therefore,
utterly left to his own views and fancies, and what he considered
grace and inspiration. He was getting too unworldly
for his position, too single-minded, and too earnest
for the easy-going clerical gentlemen who formed the bulk
of his acquaintances. Not that the majority did not do their
duty. To be sure they did; but what was it? To read a
sermon from a desk on a Sunday; to pay visits, and read a
chapter of the Bible to a dying sinner. The Evangelical
counsels, without which, in some degree or other, Christian
<i>perfection</i> is unattainable, are exploded anachronisms in the
Established of souls, as the outcry against those
within its pale, who try to revive them, but too clearly
proves. Ecclesiastical virtue, with them, does not differ
from secular virtue, any more than the virtue of a Member
of Parliament differs from that of a Town Councillor.
They are both expected to be gentlemen, and to keep the
rules of propriety the public thinks proper to expect from
their position. That is all. "Oh!" as poor Father Ignatius
used to say, "shall these dry bones live?" Thou knowest,
Lord, whether they shall or not; they don't; and in his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
time they were farther from it than they are now. We
must therefore expect, from the nature of the case, what is
to follow in the next chapter. He goes perfectly astray, in
his pursuit after what the "Church of his baptism" could
not give him. It was fortunate that he strayed in the end
from a wrong path into the right one, by the way of too far
East being West.
</p>
<p>
Easter Sunday in this year he counts the happiest day he
spent up to this, though he had only fifty-eight communicants,
a decrease since his first Easter. His point of bringing
all to the sacrament was not carried. He had even
bishops opposing him in this, as in everything else that was
not half world, half God.
</p>
<p>
The next thing he notices is, that an archdeacon gave a
good charge, "though against the Catholics,&mdash;a questionable
topic." Mr. Spencer had no special love for Catholics; on
the contrary, he thought themselves absurd, their doctrines
abominable, and their ceremonies mummery. He was of
the Spencer family though, and in them there was an inbred
love of justice and fair-play. Lord Spencer and his son,
Lord Althorp, both favoured and spoke for emancipation.
They thought the Catholics aggrieved, and if they were
Turks, they did not see why they should cease to be men
and subjects of the English crown. That was plain common
sense; besides, Mr. Spencer had not got so high in Church
views as some of his friends, who favoured Catholics before
their elevation and opposed them after it, to please a king.
The Spencers were generously liberal in all their dealings,
and even when the subject of this biography, the delight of
the family, thought fit to become a Catholic, their conduct
towards him was worthy of their name. We shall have to
refer to this afterwards; the allusion is made now only to
show that the tenour of their opinions was not the creature
of a whim or an ephemeral fancy, but a grave, steady, and
well-disciplined feeling. Praise be to them for it. Would
that their imitators were more numerous.
</p>
<p>
He has also another project on hand at this time, besides
the evangelizing of his flock. He begins to build a new
rectory. He gets an architect from London; has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
suggestions from the family about the length and breadth of the
apartments; others, more poetical, survey the site to give
their sentiments about the view from the parlour window;
the older portion have their say about the comfort of the
different rooms, with regard to size, position, and plastering.
Some few even make presents of articles of furniture, and a
near relation gives him a beautiful bed, which commodity
has many paragraphs of the journal dedicated to its praises
and suitableness. The building is at last begun, and we
must say something of the progress of his interior castle
whilst we let the bricklayers obey the orders of the builder
and architect.
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br>
Changes In His Religious Opinions.</h2>
<br>
<p>
For some time we are getting glimpses of his ways of
thought, or rather of his ways of expressing his thoughts.
We read, "godly dispositions," "mature unto repentance,"
"ripe for glory," "comfortable conversations," "springs in
barren soil," and the "<i>seeing</i> of spiritual <i>blindness</i>." All
these indicate the leaning of his mind, and recall the language
of Cromwellian "Saints," and Bunyan's dreams. The
strangest part of his proceedings now was the way in which
he became "justified." It is hardly necessary to mention
that in Calvinistic theology, which forms the basis, if not
the superstructure, of the principal part of Evangelical
postulates, the body of believers are divided into <i>elect</i> and
<i>reprobate</i>, or <i>justified</i> and <i>unconverted</i>. The election or
justification is a sentiment coming from what is supposed to
be the assurance of an interior spirit that one is to be saved.
With them, happy the man or woman who possesses this
testimony, and miserable the wretch to whom it is not
given. There is for these latter only an everlasting groping
in the dark, and a seeking for light, while the <i>insured</i> can
go through this vale of tears in exultation and gladness of
spirit. Mr. Spencer was not well versed in this particular
doctrine, and a poor woman, whom he met one day in
Northampton, undertook to bring him to the "true Gospel
light" by the "pure milk of the Word." She put together
a few of those passages from the New Testament, which are
generally misquoted in support of this outlandish theory,
and her interpretation convinced Mr. Spencer, so that he
felt justified, all at once. This good woman proved to be a
great trouble to him afterwards; she would harangue him,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
once a week, on his unconverted state, even after the <i>assurance</i>.
Her letters came regularly, four large pages, badly
and closely written; and when she had done canting on
spirituality, she would fill up what remained with the scandals
of the unconverted among whom she lived, and complaints
at the cold treatment she received from many. She
became a kind of apostle among the Dissenters, and it was
only when she had been living on Mr. Spencer's charity for
a few years that he discovered where the strength of her
spirit lay. He had reasons for not trusting to the genuineness
of her piety, though she kept continually writing from
North Shields, where she lived, sometimes in good and sometimes
in bad circumstances, since the regeneration of Mr.
Spencer. When she received one letter in which her sanctity
was made little of, she laid the blame on slanderous
tongues, and talked about suicide. Mr. Spencer then
dropped the correspondence, and gave her a sum of money
to purchase a like favour on her side.
</p>
<p>
He used to amuse us much by relating the system of
self-laudation and encouragement that kept the Evangelicals
interested in each other. One day he was describing how
a clerical friend of his became justified. He had travelled
a good distance, and was pretty tired; the family he thought
proper to honour with his holy presence in a certain town,
prepared him a most excellent breakfast. He ate with the
appetite of a very hungry man, and when a more secular
guest would have said, <i>O jam satis</i>, he jumped up from the
table and shouted with ecstatic delight, "I am justified."
He never doubted of his election to glory after that, as far
as Father Ignatius knew. The most extraordinary feature
in their modes was, that a kind of telegraphic communication
was kept up with each other, all over the country, for
the purpose of making the elect aware of the latest addition
to their numbers. On finding his brethren were disposed
to laugh at the extravagant madness of this kind of religion,
he grew quite serious, and said: "They are really in
earnest, poor things, and we ought not to laugh at them,
only to pray that their earnestness might be properly
directed." One will say: Could any man or woman with a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
grain of common sense, go on thinking and talking this kind
of unreality, which we commonly call <i>cant?</i> As a fact,
they do, and we have proof positive of it in Mr. Spencer
himself. It is astonishing to see a man of his position, good
sense, and education, talk and write in the strange way he
does, whilst this mood of mind lasted. Not only does he
write so; he holds conversations with every one whom he
meets about the state of their soul, and those which he calls
<i>interesting</i>, others considered very probably the reverse.
He also takes soundings of people's spiritual depth, and is
seldom consoled at the result. He is satisfied with no one,
except two or three of his immediate neighbours who were
fed mostly on his bounty or served in his house or garden.
He goes at this time (September, 1825) to attend Dr. Blomfield
as chaplain through the visitation of the diocese of
Chester. He is very zealous throughout, and converses on
spiritual subjects with Dissenters of all kinds as well as
Churchmen; he does not even leave behind the followers of
Joanna Southcote. Some were supposing once, in his
presence, that it was impossible for followers of Joanna
Southcote, and the like, not to be fully aware that they were
being deluded. Father Ignatius said it was not so, and
related a peculiar case that he witnessed himself. He happened
to be passing through Birmingham (perhaps it was
after he became a Catholic), and had occasion to enter a
shop there to order something. The shopkeeper asked him
if he had heard of the great light that had arisen in these
modern times. He said no. "Well then," repeated the
shopman, "here, sir, is something to enlighten you," handing
him a neatly got up pamphlet. He had not time to
glance at the title when his friend behind the counter ran
on at a great rate in a speech something to the following
effect. That the four Gospels were all figures and myths,
that the Epistles were only faint foreshadowings of the real
sun of justice that was now at length arisen. The Messias
was come in the person of a Mr. Ward, and he would see
the truth demonstrated beyond the possibility of a doubt
by looking at the Gospel he held in his hand. Whilst the
shopman was expressing hopes of converting him, he took
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
the opportunity of looking at the pamphlet, and found that
all this new theory of religion was built upon a particular
way of printing the text, <i>Glory be to God on high, and on
earth peace to</i>-WARD'S <i>men</i>. On turning away in disgust
from his fruitless remonstrances with this specimen of
WARD'S <i>men</i>, he found some of WARD'S <i>women</i> also in the
same place; and overheard them exclaiming, "Oh! little
England knows what a treasure they have in &mdash;&mdash; jail."
The pretended Messias happened to be in prison for felony
at the time. He assured us that these poor creatures were
perfectly sincere and earnest in the faith they had in this
malefactor.
</p>
<p>
The characteristic features of the Low Church school, or
whatever name the religious bias of Mr. Spencer's mind at
this time may be called, are, a certain self-sufficiency and
rank spiritual pride. It begins with self and ends with self.
From self springs the assurance of salvation, for self's sake,
too, and every one must feel him<i>self</i> in this mood before he
can rely on himself. When this fancy gets possession of a
person's mind, they forthwith turn apostles, borrow the language
of inspiration even for table-talk, and no person is in
the way of salvation at all who does not completely fall in
with the stream of the new flood of ideas this notion brings
into the "<i>regenerated</i>" mind. No matter how worthy or
great any person may seem to the reprobate world, and did
seem to the newly-made "saint" before the assurance, they
are now dark, lost, but hopeful if they listen patiently to
one half-hour's discourse upon the movements of the Spirit.
The vagaries of each mind are in proportion to the imagination,
and the facilities for expanding them by giving them
expression. But far or near as they may go, self, proud
self, is the beginning and end of them all.
</p>
<p>
The woman who was instrumental in "regenerating"
Mr. Spencer writes in one letter to say that she has "no
pride," and that no one ever could accuse her of being
infected with this passion. At the same time, ay, in the
very next sentence, we have wrath and indignation at some
of the unregenerate who do not think proper to pay court
to her. The sweeping condemnations hurled against two or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
three worthy clergymen, which opened Mr. Spencer's eyes
to the imposition practised upon him, are further evidences
of the same spirit. Mr. Spencer's own ways of acting will
be a fair sample of this kind of thing. During his visit to
Chester in 1825, he lectures the Bishop on several different
occasions, and considers himself quite qualified to do so by
virtue of the new spirit he has imbibed. One of the conversations
he describes thus:&mdash;"After dinner we had an
animated discussion, in which I took a lead against the field
almost. Before going to bed, I had half an hour's private
conversation with the Bishop, most interesting <i>on his account</i>.
I humbly thank God who has heard my prayers, and made
me a lowly instrument in His hands for the good of this
already admirable man." In the next sentence he tells us
that, in travelling home to Althorp, "I did not read much,
but thank God was enabled to keep my mind in godly
meditation almost all the way. God knows how blind and
perplexed I am still." We have taken the liberty to mark
some words in italics in the first quotation, as they show
what is confirmed by other passages, too numerous to be
quoted, how high he had risen in his own estimation when
he considered a bishop benefited by half an hour's conversation
with him. He is very hopeful, though, of bringing
all the world to his ideas, and says of his family: "God
grant me the continuance of that kindness which lies
between me and all my family till such time as their hearts
may be truly opened to my word." Another reason why
we are rather sparing in extracts is a respect for a passage
which occurs here in the journal. "I have put down many
circumstances in this journal relating to private discussions
with persons in religion. Should they fall into strange
hands, be they bound in conscience to use them discreetly."
We simply quote what is necessary to give a correct notion
of the state of his mind. He carried his zeal a little too
far betimes, "he went so far as to consider it the duty of a
clergyman to call on and rebuke any brother clergyman,
whom he might consider negligent in his ministerial office."
</p>
<p>
Thus a fellow-clergyman writes:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  He got into some difficulties at this time in consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
  of reporting to his bishop a clergyman who would not listen
  to his remonstrances; but mutual explanations succeeded in
  making everything right. The clergyman in question lived
  away from his cure, and thought proper to enjoy unclerical,
  but otherwise harmless, sports. Mr. Spencer, of course,
  was against this, but did not succeed in imbuing the other
  with his sentiments. Notwithstanding these notions of
  self-righteousness,
  he was far from incurring much censure for
  officiousness. His character and mode of life gained him so
  much respect that he could administer even reproof without
  provoking anger, except where it was too richly deserved.
  A letter of Dr. Blomfield's to him after this visit, bears out
  this remark. The Bishop says: ... "I hope you will
  look back on your visit to Chester with pleasure. You
  may have the satisfaction of believing that you have done
  good to many <i>young</i> clergymen, who had an opportunity of
  conversing with you, if not to many <i>old</i> ones. I was very
  glad to set before them the example of a young man of rank
  and good prospects devoted in singleness of heart to the
  duties of his holy calling."
</p>
<p>
That his single-mindedness and piety should have thus led
him astray is not to be wondered at; for, besides the want
of a state where such virtues could be properly cultivated,
he had to breathe a religion whose first principles tend
directly that way. The exercise of private judgment in
what primarily concerns salvation must always lead one
astray, because articles of faith are not creatures of human
intelligence, neither are they within its compass to understand.
He had, of course, a private judgment shackled by
contradictions, as every subscriber of the Thirty-nine
Articles has. He had an authority to obey which gave a dubious
sound, and he was told plainly by the same voice that itself
was defectible; the only tie to obedience was the condition
on which he discharged his clerical functions; it was natural
that he should see through this, from his very single-mindedness,
and overlook the conditions while trying to unravel
the knots with which they bound him. His birthday
reflections this year, 1825, show that he did not begin to
retrace his steps. They are as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Dec. 21. ...</span>
  This day sees me 26 years old, and blessed be my Almighty
  Protector, the last year has greatly advanced me in hope
  and knowledge of salvation. A reference to my observations
  last birthday shows me a great alteration in my views.
  What admirable methods does He employ in bringing sinners
  to himself? During the last half-year I reckon I must
  fix the time when by the most unlikely means God has
  brought me to faith and knowledge of His grace. I solemnly
  devote the next year and every day and hour and minute of
  my future life to coming nearer to Him, to learning His
  ways and word, and to leading others to the same knowledge,
  in which He has caused me to exult with a joy formerly
  unknown."
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br>
Opposition To His Religious Views.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Mr. Spencer was so taken with his new birth that he tried
to have all his friends and acquaintances born again after
his own fashion. He made no secret, therefore, of his religious
leaning; by letter and word of mouth he tried to
bring all to his side. We find, from his correspondence at
this time, a shower of letters from every point of the clerical
compass where there was authority or influence enough to
muster a cloud for their discharge. In looking over such of
the letters as he has thought well to preserve, one is struck
at once with the diversity of opinion. It is better not to
give names, perhaps; but a few sentences from each may
not be out of place.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Rev. Mr. A.&mdash;</span>
  "I have read your letter through with
  great care, and I can say with truth, that it has produced
  much the same effect upon the eye of my mind which the
  full blaze of the meridian sun sometimes produces upon the
  natural eye. It has been almost too much for me." The
  letter goes on encouraging him in his spirit, fortifying him
  against all carnal opposition. This gentleman is of the same
  mind as Mr. Spencer, but more glowing in his zeal for the
  great cause of Gospel freedom.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Rev. Mr. B.&mdash;</span>
  "I address myself to one who, from that
  love of Christ which passeth knowledge, has evinced an
  anxiety for me, who am less than the least of all saints, and
  an unprofitable minister of the Gospel of God." This gentleman's
  language is of the right stamp; but he does not agree
  so perfectly, and arranges for a meeting, where they are to
  have a mutual adjustment of ideas.

<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Rev. Mr. C.&mdash;</span>
  "This is very well at the commencement.
  I trust the Lord will add more, in the best sense of that
  expression."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Rev. Mr. D.&mdash;</span>
  ".... To this I will never consent
  [renewing left off discussions], being satisfied (as I have
  before stated to you) that every man who is able and willing
  and sincerely endeavouring to learn and practise his duty,
  ought to be left in the quiet and undisturbed possession of
  his own conscience, and not forced from it against his will
  by others who happen to form a different judgment. In
  our former conversations, you told me, as plainly as language
  could well do, though perhaps not entirely at one interview,
  that you considered me to be an unconverted sinner, as
  destitute of the truth as any heathen could be, and in a
  state of perdition; and you seemed to think that I could be
  recovered from that fearful condition by that horrid system
  of indiscriminate condemnation and terror which prevails (I
  find) at Northampton in its most odious form, and which I
  believe to be essentially opposed to the principles of the
  Christian religion, as it is repugnant to those natural feelings
  of kindness and benevolence which God has implanted
  in the human breast."
</p>
<p>
It might be fairer to transcribe his
entire letter; but then the other letters have the same claim,
and that would make a new volume, for some of the letters
extend over fifteen pages of foolscap paper, closely written.
The sum of the remaining part is this, that he is twenty-one
years in holy orders, and that God could not have allowed
him to be in error all that time. He says that, "I never
can for one moment admit that any one is more anxious
for my happiness than I am myself, nor that any person has
a greater right to decide than I have by what means that
happiness shall be sought. A man's own conscientious
judgment is the proper guide in such cases." He then refers
Mr. Spencer to others more learned than he for the discussion
of those matters, and mentions the Bishop of Chester
and John Rose, "whose qualifications for the task are
incomparably superior to mine." This gentleman seems to
hesitate between Mr. Spencer's opinions and his own, and is
rather uneasy lest he might be wrong, yet does not see
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
the use of troubling himself, as it is all the same in the
end, when one tries to do what his conscience tells him is
right.
</p>
<p>
Rev. Mr. E. is a doctor, so let us listen to him. After a
rhetorical preface, in which he would make excuses but
would not, because they were such friends and did not want
them, for handling his friend so summarily, he thus launches
forth:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Although there can be but <i>one</i> line of duty marked
  out in the situation of <i>every</i> clergyman, and although, before
  God, the humblest and the loftiest in that profession are
  equally bounden to <i>pursue</i> the same line of duty, and are,
  moreover, equally frail and 'found wanting,'&mdash;yet I cannot
  bring myself to consider yours as by any means an <i>ordinary</i>
  case."
</p>
<p>
After thus magnifying the importance of his
subject, he neither agrees nor disagrees, but discountenances
Mr. Spencer's practices on prudential motives. He
staves off the whole matter of doctrine, and talks about
discipline.
</p>
<p>
The next quotation will be from a bishop. He very
wisely and keenly observes:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Amidst a great deal that is
  excellent and of right spirit in your observations, there is
  a presumption and self-confident tone, which is altogether
  new in <i>you</i>, and in my opinion not very consistent with real
  humility. In fact, I almost wonder that this symptom, if
  you have ever recalled to mind your conversations, or read
  over your letters when written, has not made you doubt the
  reality of what you call your conversion; for I remember
  perfectly well your having observed to me, that the extreme
  confidence of those who hold Calvinistic opinions as to their
  own case, and their extreme uncharitableness towards, or
  rather <i>concerning</i> others, were strong indications of some
  radical error in their notions, and so they will ever be
  considered by those who take the same view with St.
  Paul of Christian charity."
</p>
<p>
The Bishop then states the
case very clearly at issue between them, and points how
far they agree and disagree upon the point of <i>assurance</i>
and reliance on the merits of Christ, and proves his side
of the question by Scripture, Anglican divines, and common
sense.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
<p>
It is a very singular thing that this bishop, when he first
heard of the manifestations of Mr. Spencers Calvinistic
spirit, concludes a short letter to him thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I recommend
  to your perusal a most interesting tract, which Blanco
  White has just published, 'The Poor Man's Preservative
  against Popery.'
<br><br>
  "Ever yours affectionately,
    *****"
</p>
<p>
These specimens are picked at random from a heap of
letters. It looks incomprehensible to a Catholic how such a
state of things could be possible in a system calling itself a
Church. Not one of these, who were the clergy working
with him in the same field and in the same way, dared to
say, or knew how to say, "You have uttered a heresy."
Some agreed with him, some applauded him, some wanted
to be left alone in their old doctrines, and some begged leave
very politely to differ from him, and gave their reasons for
so doing. The Bishop argued warmly against him, but Mr.
Spencer took up his lordship, and argued quite as warmly
for the other side of the question. If he did not put them
among the reprobate, they should very likely have let him
alone. Such was the state of <i>dogma</i> in the Establishment
in the beginning of 1826; it is scarcely improved, except in
its own way, in 1865. No definite teaching, nothing positive,
nothing precise, all mist, doubt, uncertainty, except
that Popery is anti-Christian and subversive of human
liberty.
</p>
<p>
It is very hard to imagine, much less to realize, how these
lukewarm expressions of assent and dissent turned, in a few
months, into a tempest of opposition. Perhaps the following
guess would nearly account for it. We may conclude
from the letter of Lady Spencer to Dr. Blomfield (given in
his life, page 70), on his being appointed to the see of
Chester, that she and Lord Spencer knew something about
the making of bishops and the mode of their <i>translation</i>.
If she took such an interest in a stranger, but a friend, it is
not wonderful that she should take a similar, if not a greater,
interest in seeing a mitre on the head of her own son. Lord
Liverpool had not yet retired from the head of the ministry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
and if his politics and Lord Spencer's were sufficiently of
accord to promote the man whom the Earl patronized, they
would be able to do a like service to the Earl's own son in
due course. Extreme Low Church views would never do
for the Episcopal Bench in those days, though many were
raised to that dignity with little High Church views. Whether
Mr. Spencer's opinions clouded this bright future, or
that the noble family would feel it a disgrace to have a son
so methodistical, or whether real anxiety for his spiritual
welfare, or an endeavour to prevent a future that the Bishop's
ken seemed to have forecasted, troubled his parents, it is
difficult to say. At all events, Mr. Spencer's religious
notions caused a great commotion in the family, whilst those
who abetted and encouraged him went on preaching their
sermons and reading their services in their position, with
one exception, and nobody seemed to mind them.
</p>
<p>
Lady Spencer took her son to London, in the beginning
of the year 1826, to have his new notions rectified by Dr.
Blomfield. This good doctor immediately prescribed for
his patient, for he did not need much feeling of his spiritual
pulse after their correspondence. The interview is thus
described:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Jan. 24.&mdash;</span>My mother    allowed me her carriage
  after breakfast, to go and see the Bishop of Chester.
  I did not find him at home, and so came directly back again.
  He was so good as to call on me afterwards, and sat talking
  with me a considerable time. His conversation was most
  pleasing to me, though I could see that we did not fully
  agree in our view of Christian doctrine (<i>sic</i>). He desired
  me to read Sumner's 'Apostolical Preaching,' which I sent
  out for and began doing before dinner."
</p>
<p>
His obedience to directors of all kinds was remarkable;
but the results were invariably contrary to their expectations.
He began this book at once, and be it remembered,
he had read it twice before. Next day he read on, and
"marked many passages which he thought decidedly wrong."
He goes out a little, sees an old friend, and delights in reading
Cowper's "Task," exclaiming, "It is a great thing to be a
true Christian." He visits the Bishop in a day or two; they
hold a discussion, but part in charity; and the result was,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
that Mr. Spencer wrote him "the memorable letter" which
scarcely left his lordship a hope of salvation if he did not at
once get assured of his election.
</p>
<p>
A correspondence ensues now, which terminates in a
promise given and accepted of a longer stay in London,
where matters may be settled in conversation to their
mutual satisfaction. In the mean time, Mr. Spencer returns
to his parish, and begins reading the New Testament in
Greek (another of Dr. Blomfield's prescriptions). As he lays
down the volume one day he exclaims, "How do I want the
milk of God's word!"
</p>
<p>
An old lady whom he visits, in illness, dozes into a stupor,
and awakens unto Gospel faith. One evening he says:&mdash;"I
spent this evening with a mixture of scrupulosities and comforts,
but trust soon to find out what is the true Gospel
freedom." There seem still some relics of the old asceticism
left in him, for on having to go to Peterborough on some
business, he says:&mdash;"I started in a chaise for Peterborough.
I had scruples about the heavy expense of this mode instead
of coaches; but I was consoled by the opportunity I had on
the way of calling at Titchmarsh, and having half an hour's
conversation with Lyttelton Powys. I got to Peterborough
at 4, dined with the dean and his lady at 6, and spent the
evening in hearing extracts from his intended life of Bentley.
I found myself in a land, alas! of spiritual barrenness; but
water-springs may rise in dry ground."
</p>
<p>
It was about this time, March, 1826, that he seems to
have given up reading anything in the way of theology,
except the Bible. He gives an odd dip into Cowper's
poems, by way of recreation. He came across a book called
"The Convent," but immediately "discovered it to be anti-Christian."
This apparent quiet is, however, disturbed by
the play of the clerical artillery around him. The tone of
one or two extracts from the letters he received now will
give an idea of the vantage-ground these good champions of
orthodoxy thought proper to take. One writes:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I know you did think it un-Christian-like to converse or
  employ the mind much on any subject but religion. To this
  almost entire exclusion of all other topics I decidedly object,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
  on the ground of its having a strong tendency to engender a
  pharisaical spirit, and of its being inconsistent with the
  common duties and occupations of life marked out for us by
  Providence, and contrary to the true interests of genuine
  Christianity. And my opinion in this respect has the sanction
  of some of the most excellent characters I have ever
  known&mdash;persons eminent alike for sound wisdom and discretion,
  and for a quiet and unostentatious, but sincere and
  fervent piety.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I cannot conclude this letter without remarking, that
  all your conversations with me, since you adopted your
  present views, have convinced me more and more that my
  own religious opinions are sound and yours erroneous; and
  that every day's experience confirms and strengthens me in
  the conviction, that the religious system which your friends
  at Northampton are pursuing (whatever charm it may have
  for enthusiastic minds) <i>is not the religion of the Bible</i>."
</p>
<p>
This is from the grumbler quoted above, as may be seen by the
style and sentiment.
</p>
<p>
Our friend the doctor calls him to task in this manner:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  ".... You are endeavouring to make up for past
  deficiencies, or to atone for past errors, by renewed activity
  or rather extraordinary efforts. This you do in perfect
  sincerity; and, I believe, heartily. In consequence, instead
  of <i>one</i> sermon on a Sunday there are <i>two</i>; instead of a
  <i>quarterly</i> there is a <i>monthly</i> sacrament; and, in addition,
  an evening lecture, with prayers, is pronounced every Wednesday
  evening. Now, supposing you had not taken this
  unfavourable opinion of your past feelings and views, would
  you have adopted such regulations? I think you would
  <i>not</i>; and yet, be it observed, the necessity for them was and
  is a matter totally irrelevant to your own private feelings."
</p>
<p>
The rest of this letter, the doctor's second, is to sober down
Mr. Spencer's fervour, and make him go on quietly, hoping
thus to slacken his enthusiasm and bring him to his former
frame of mind.
</p>
<p>
It is sad to see a clergyman called to task for not being
more worldly and less zealous. He is, in fact, too much
like a Catholic Saint to be endured in the Establishment.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
He must eventually abandon it, or be stoned to death with
hard words in it. We see the chink now through which
the first alternative gleamed on the Bishop; and we see the
disposition of Providence in moving him to confine himself
to the Bible, when some plausible Anglican work might
have burnished up what he had of Catholic instinct, and
made it seem gold.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br>
Progress Of His Religious Views.</h2>
<br>
<p>
It must not be supposed that Mr. Spencer broke away from
the Establishment by the religious notions he took up at
this time; on the contrary, his great hope is that he shall
unite all the sects to her, and he fancies they are being
realized now among the Methodists in his own parish. His
cardinal point of opinion at this time was, that the articles
and formularies of the Anglican Church required some kind
of soul to put life into them and make them touch the heart;
that this life had been allowed to eke out of the Church in the
days bygone, and that it was high time to bring it back; the
wording of the Church's text-books gave room for his interpretation,
and his whole line of procedure was but acting
upon it. Others interpreted differently, some did not interpret
at all; with both classes of opponents he maintained an
opposition so satisfactory to himself that his notions only
gained a stronger hold of his mind every day. We shall
give some specimens of the arguments urged against him by
the second class of opponents, who were chiefly influential
members of his own family. One writes,&mdash;his father:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I will commission Appleyard to get the Hebrew grammar
  you mention and send it down, and I am very glad to hear
  that you intend to revive that study, which must be so
  useful to a clergyman, and which will I hope be an advantage
  to your mind by varying the objects to which you
  apply it, and by that means tend to relieve it from the
  effects of too intense an application to the more difficult
  and abstruse points of religious study; which, if not under
  the corrective guidance of greater learning and experience
  than it is possible for you yet to have, might lead into the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
  wildness of enthusiasm, instead of the sensible and sound
  doctrine which it becomes an orthodox minister of an
  Established Church to hold for himself and to preach to
  others."
</p>
<p>
Another,&mdash;his mother:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Infinite peril attends the setting
  our duties and religious notions in too austere a point of
  view, and seeming mystic and obscure modes of speech when
  describing religious sentiments; and disparaging every effort
  to do right except it tallies exactly with some indescribable
  rule of faith which cannot be comprehended by simple-minded
  and quiet-tempered piety, is of all things the most
  dangerous, since the risk is dreadful either of disgusting, or
  repelling, or alarming into despair. Nothing proves the
  perfect ignorance of human character and the art of persuasion
  than this process. It never can do to terrify into
  doing right,&mdash;stubbornness and hopelessness must ever be
  the consequence of such ill-judged zeal; and to the preacher
  uncharitableness and spiritual pride. Milton's beautiful
  meditation of our Saviour, in 'Paradise Regained,' has two
  lines which exactly fill my idea of what ought to be the
  mode of doing good by precept:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
         "By winning words to conquer willing hearts,
         And make persuasion do the work of fear."
</pre>
<p class="cite">
  .... Do not permit yourself to judge uncharitably
  of the motives of others because their religious sentiments
  are not always floating on the surface of their words and
  actions."
</p>
<p>
The remonstrances descend in a graduated scale from these
elegant remarks, through letters from old schoolfellows in
an off-hand style; frisky young matrons twit him in a very
airy kind of argument, and all seems to wind up in a flourish
from a young officer, "How dy'e do, my dear old parson;
ever in the dumps, eh?"
</p>
<p>
The long visit to London is at length brought about. He
writes in the journal:&mdash;"April 13, 1826. At 9 set off
for London. I leave Althorp for a longer period than I have
since taking orders. May God make it a profitable excursion!"
This visit was planned by the family and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
Dr. Blomfield, when they saw letters were unavailing, in order
that Spencer might be brought, by conversing with his old
master, into tamer notions on religion.
</p>
<p>
He accordingly dines and speaks with the Bishop and
some clerical friends, but the result was this note in the
journal:&mdash;"I feel myself in this great town like St. Paul in
Athens. Not one like-minded man can I now think of to
whom I can resort. But God shall raise me some." The
next Sunday after his arrival in London he is asked by Dr.
Blomfield to preach in St. Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate
street. This sermon was to be a kind of profession of his
faith. His own commentaries on it are thus: "I had the
wonderful glory of preaching a full and free gospel discourse
in the afternoon to a London congregation, and God gave
me perfect composure and boldness; and although he liked
not the doctrine, the Bishop was perfectly kind to me afterwards."
The Rev. Mr. Harvey, Rector of Hornsey, says,
in a letter he had the kindness to write to one of our
fathers: "My first acquaintance with Mr. Spencer was
about 1824 or 1825, when I was curate of St. Botolph's,
Bishopsgate, of which Archdeacon Blomfield, afterwards
Bishop of London, was rector. Mr. Spencer had been a
pupil of the Bishop's, and was always regarded by him with
great interest. He generally came to him to stay for a few
days in the spring, and used then to come and see me, and
accompany me in my pastoral visits. He was a person of a
most tender and loving spirit, very distrustful of himself,
and very anxious to arrive at truth. On one occasion I
remember his preaching on a Sunday afternoon at St.
Botolph's, when Dr. Blomfield, then Bishop of Chester, read
prayers. To the surprise of every one he took the opportunity
of explaining his particular views of religion, which
were then decidedly evangelical, intimating to the congregation
that they were not accustomed generally to
have the Gospel fully and faithfully preached. The Bishop
of course was pained, but merely said, 'George, how
could you preach such a sermon as that? In future
I must look over your sermon before you go into the
pulpit.' I do not vouch for the details, but this is what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
I recollect as far as my memory helps me at this distance
of time."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Spencer went to hear others preach, and forms his
opinions of each according to his way of thinking. Here
are some specimens:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The Bishop of Bristol preached in the morning for the
  schools, a sermon worthy of Plato rather than St. Paul."
  Another day: "Went with all speed to Craven Chapel,
  where I heard Irving, the Scotch minister, preach nearly
  two hours. I was greatly delighted at his eloquence and
  stout Christian doctrine, though his manner is most blameably
  extravagant." Another day: "I went with Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;
  and Miss B&mdash;&mdash; to hear Mrs. Fry perform, and was delighted
  with her <i>expounding</i> to the prisoners in Newgate."
</p>
<p>
He seems to advance more and more in his own religious
views; and he says his father was wretched about them.
He gets an opportunity of preaching in the West End of
London, and writes thereupon: "O my God, I have testified
thy truth to east and west in this horrid Babylon." He
soon after returns home, and is so far improved that he
determines to preach extempore for the future; in this he
succeeds very well. What led him to this resolve was the
facility with which he could maintain a conversation on
religious topics for any length of time, and the rational
supposition that he might do the same, as well in the pulpit
as in the parlour.
</p>
<p>
A letter to the Rev. Mr. Harvey, which is the only one
that we have come across of those written by him at this
time, gives a fair idea of the state of his mind: it was written
on his return to Althorp after this London visit.
</p>
<p class="cite">
    "<i>August 3, 1826.</i>
<br><br>
  "My Dear Harvey,&mdash;Bishop Heber's sermon I think
  beautiful. I am also pleased with all that has come of late
  from Bishop Sumner. His apostolic preaching does not
  fully satisfy me, and I have little doubt, from his writings,
  that he would not consider it as exactly representing his
  present views. .... It must be admitted that St.
  Paul's sins before his conversion are not so heinous as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
  those of many who have not ignorance and unbelief to plead
  in their favour. ....  With regard to the question
  whether we be under guilt and eternal wrath, or in the
  favour of God and on the way of life, it seems to me highly
  dangerous to look to any distinction but this plain one,
  'He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the
  Son of God hath not life.' .... Having thus ventured
  an opinion to you, I will go on to say that I wish I
  could have some conversation with you at large on these
  matters. I do not wish to introduce discussions on these
  points with my brethren, except when I am led to it by
  circumstances, and therefore I never entered on the subject
  with you during my stay in London. I have sometimes
  blamed myself for it, because you seemed to me to be so
  candid and unprejudiced that I might have done so without
  any risk of displeasure. I now tell you that I was much
  pleased always with the spirit of your sermons and with all
  your feelings, as far as I could judge of them from conversation;
  but I could plainly perceive that your views of fundamental
  doctrines were not what, I am convinced, are the
  right ones according to the Word of God and the Articles
  of our Church. The Bishop would have told you, I suppose,
  that he and I were at variance on these points, though in
  mutual regard and attachment I humbly trust we never
  before were so nearly united. Indeed, I never had an argument
  with him which did not leave me in admiration of
  his genuine meekness and charity. .... I reckon
  him very nearly right, and I am sure that he has real
  humility and an inquiring spirit; and so I firmly trust that,
  by God's blessing, he will be led to acknowledge the whole
  truth, and that very shortly. .... All that I venture
  to say is that he has not, to my mind, yet taken the
  right view of the plan of Redemption. But I am so convinced
  of his being on the right way to it, that I could
  almost engage to acknowledge my own views wrong (though
  I have not a single doubt of them now), if, before his departure,
  which God send may be distant, he does not declare
  his assent to them. I believe that you are just of the same
  mind on these things, as I was myself a year or two ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
  You probably know that my present views are of comparatively
  recent date with me. They are, in fact, what I have
  at last settled into, after two or three years of extreme
  doubts and oscillations and scrupulosities. I thank God that
  from all these He has delivered me, except the trouble and
  annoyance of my own evil heart, from which, however, I do
  not expect complete freedom, while in this tabernacle. As
  to writers on the subject, I have none, besides the formularies
  of our Church, whose doctrines and principles I like
  better than Thomas Scott's. There are some points of discipline,
  however, in which I do not go along with him.
  But I now attach myself most exclusively to the Word of
  God and prayer, as the method of increasing in knowledge,
  and feel delighted in the freedom which I have gained from
  the variety of opinions of learned men, which used to
  perplex me so grievously."
</p>
<p>
This is what he looked upon as being in the Gospel
freedom, that he was free from doctors; and it is a freedom.
If Anglican doctors were, like our theologians, all of a mind
in doctrine, with a certain margin for diversity of opinion
in things of minor consequence, or in the way of clearing
up a difficulty, it might be borne; but when one has theologians
for guides who agree about as much as one living
clergyman agrees with another, it is surely a freedom to be
delivered from a yoke that presses on so many sides, and
forces so many ways at once.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
Some Of The Practical Effects Of His Views.</h2>
<br>
<p>
It is high time that we should turn from the abstract consideration
of Mr. Spencer's views, and test their efficiency by
the great standard of good and evil&mdash;facts. The facts, bearing
upon our subject, which the Journal gives up to this period
of his life, the close of 1826, and beginning of the next year,
may be summed up in few words. One old woman was the
only one of whom he could say, "she seems fully established
in religion;" and it is remarkable that this very person,
Mrs. Wykes, became a Catholic later on. All the rest were
in different stages of fermentation; some "hopeful," some
"promising," some "ripening unto light," and so forth:
they ripen more and more according to the number of his
visits; but if it should happen that they did not need material
help from him, they very soon got back to their old
way again, and poor Mr. Spencer used to return, after his
day's apostleship, much humiliated at his want of success.
In fact, his missionary work was a perfect representation of
Protestant missions to the heathen. He distributed Bibles
and blankets, prayer-books and porridge, and three of his
best and most hopeful proselytes went mad, and were sent
to the county lunatic asylum. Of himself, he tells us that
he used to spend from two to three hours daily in godly
contemplation. Of this he began to get tired after some
time, and gives the following extraordinary notions of his
interior state:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Sep. 2.</span> I was employed chiefly in reading
  Gr. Testament; but I find myself very far yet from that
  state of real activity of mind which I ought to gain. I
  wish for such experience in Christ as not to need spiritual
  exercises as constantly as I now do to keep up communion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
  with God, and so have more time for active labour."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Sep. 12.</span> I went to Nobottle at 12 and returned at 3.
  I called in every house except Chapman's, and, alas! I
  found <i>not one soul</i> over whom I could rejoice as a true child
  of God. Yet there are signs of hope in a few. What an
  awful scene it would be if I had eyes to see it, or how great
  is my deliverance, who, though not less deserving perdition
  than any, am yet planted in the House of God, and rejoice
  through Christ in the hope of His glory."
</p>
<p>
He begins the new year, 1827, with the following:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have found my
  mind so far from settled that I never saw myself more in
  need of God's grace. But I shall find it."
</p>
<p>
Strange prophecy;
he was determined never to rest content until he
could feel right with regard to God and his salvation, and
it is needless to say that he was far from this,
notwithstanding his great Calvinistic assurance.
</p>
<p>
Every new Dissenting minister that comes into his
parish, he makes it his business to call upon and see if they
could not unite their respective flocks, even by compromising
differences. He sometimes comes home flushed with
hope, and then, when he tries to persuade his fellow-clergymen
of the Establishment to make advances to Methodists
or Baptists, their coldness brings his hopes to nought.
Nothing disheartened, he comes to the charge again, and is
buoyed up, the whole time, by the hope of one day or other
seeing his beloved people in one fold, under the care of one
shepherd.
</p>
<p>
He removes in the middle of this year to the house he
built for himself at Great Brington, and he learns the
pleasures of housekeeping in a few weeks by the difficulties
he encounters in the management of servants. The rest of
the year, until towards October, goes on rather calmly; no
incident of importance occurs except the preaching of his
Visitation Sermon. The Bishop of Peterborough, Dr.
Marsh, comes to make his diocesan visitation in Northampton,
and the Honble. and Rev. Mr. Spencer is asked to
preach before him. He does so very nervously, and
although he introduces one passage into that sermon indicative
of his peculiar views, the Bishop was so pleased with it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
that he ordered him to print it. It was printed accordingly,
and Mr. Spencer sent copies to all the friends he
could remember; he even sent some across the Atlantic to
old schoolfellows. Between thanks for the reception of
this favour, and mutual acknowledgments of esteem and
regard, with compliments and returns of the same, an
interval is given him to prepare for another storm on the
score of his opinions.
</p>
<p>
The second volume of his diary concludes with some distressing
discussions and family animadversions on his ways
of thinking. It sounds rather strange in Catholic ears that
lay people should deem themselves qualified to lecture a
clergyman on what he ought to believe and teach; it ought
not, if he remembers that we are speaking of a land of private
judgment, where every one is qualified to think and
dictate to his neighbour. The friends take their arguments
now from a different point. Mr. Spencer had built his
new rectory and gone to live there; the architect had done
his part so well, that he would sometimes come off the
coach, when passing near Brington, so that he might have
another look at this specimen of material comfort. It was
furnished, too, in a befitting style, for George went even to
London, and took counsel with his mother and others on
what things were proper and best suited for a parsonage.
The best upholsterers were made to contribute from their
stock of cupboards, beds, mattresses, chairs, and tables, and
when the van arrived at Brington, there were several connoisseur
female relatives invited to give their opinions on
the colouring and papering of the rooms, the hanging and
folds of the window curtains, and the patterns of the carpets.
All was finally arranged to the satisfaction of all parties,
and only one thing was wanting,&mdash;"the partner of his joys,"
or troubles, as they would be now, poor man.
</p>
<p>
Bright ideas struck his friends about this time. It was
thought, in very high and intellectual circles, that if the
young rector of Brington were married, he would settle
down quietly in the snug parsonage, and make metaphysical
ideas give way to the realities of life. This they concluded
was the short road to his settlement, and he himself used
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
often to tell how long arguments on religious views often
ended with, "Well, George, get yourself a wife, and
settle down like your neighbours, and all these dreams will
vanish." To their surprise, however, they found the young
rector as difficult of persuasion in this point as in his other
notions; but experience gave them the advantage over him
here, and they were determined not to be foiled. The want
of a house to bring the bride to, was thought to be the sole
objection heretofore, and perhaps it was; that was now
removed. Suggestions to that effect reach him in letters
from his friends about this time. The following is a
specimen:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is probable that I shall return to Brington for
  the winter. If N *** or N *** succeeds in a matrimonial
  alliance on your account, I hope you will speedily
  let me know; perhaps an insinuating advertisement in the
  <i>Morning Post</i> might be useful to you. Joking apart, I
  shall be most happy when the time comes for wishing you
  joy."
</p>
<p>
Insinuations and arguments did not avail, so they
had recourse to stratagem. One would not like to suspect
that the Bishop of Chester was let into the secret, though
he ought to be a capital hand at such things, as he had the
hymeneal knot twice tied upon himself. However that may
be, the plot was laid, hatched, and the eggs broken as
follows:&mdash;Towards the end of October, 1827, he accompanied
Dr. Blomfield on a visitation through the diocese of Chester.
He was taken a little out of his way in order to preach in
a church near Warrington. The rector of this place asked
him specially;&mdash;what was his surprise to find his "old
flame," Miss A ***, as mentioned in a former chapter,
there ready prepared to be one of his listeners. He walked
with her to church, and was delighted with her company;
he used to say he never preached, whilst a minister, with
greater satisfaction than on that day. Coming home from
church he had to hear out compliments about his preaching,
and he spent the evening with a clerical party&mdash;one was a
clergyman who was about being married to the sister of
Mr. Spencer's favourite. It was thought everything would
come round then, and that some kind of arrangement would
be made for the future; but Mr. Spencer, though pleased,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
was not anywise romantic, nor apt to put his head into a
halter from which it would not be so easy to draw it back.
It was well, however, that he was pleased, and he evinces
as much himself in his Journal, when he says:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Sunday, Oct. 21.</span>
  I begin this volume with one of the most interesting
  Sundays I have ever spent. After breakfast with
  Mr. ***'s family, we went to church about half a mile
  from the house, where I preached the first sermon which it
  has been given me to preach in this diocese; and I am
  pleased that it should be in this church and before N ***
  N *** among other hearers, with whom I now converse
  as pleasingly as in former times, but on higher subjects.
  With her and her sister I walked home, and again to evening
  service, where I read prayers and Mr. *** preached."
</p>
<p>
But this argument met the fate of all that had been spent
on him for the last three years. It seemed all settled as
far as he was concerned; for there was no doubt on the
other side. He got into his carriage to drive up to Althorp,
and ask his father's consent. When near the door, he
called to the driver to stop, and turn to the rectory. He had
just formed the resolution <i>never to marry</i>. It was not that
he did not like the intended partner, it was an affair of long
standing; but he remembered the words of St. Paul: "He that
is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord,
how he may please the Lord: But he that is married careth
for the things that are of the world, how he may please his
wife" (1 Cor. vii. 32, 33, Prot. version). No one was ever
able to shake this resolution, and the repeated attempts of
others to do so only strengthened it the more. He often
related this incident to us, and when asked, if he then
thought of the Catholic priests, "Oh, I might, but I thought
it was some superstitious motive that made them live single;
I thought I made a new discovery myself;" he would
reply.
</p>
<p>
A change takes places now in his finances. He was
Always extremely charitable, and his housekeeper tells of
his equipment, when going out to make his parish rounds,
of a morning. He would carry a bottle of wine in his coat
pocket, and as much money as he could possibly spare.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
These he distributed among the sick and the poor. He
used also to buy them medicines, and procure them clothes.
Of course it was found soon that a very large income would
not suffice for the liberality of the son, so Lord Spencer
came to an arrangement with him. He allowed him a
liberal yearly income; but George feels it rather hard, and
complains of his straitened means in two or three places of
his Journal. However, he set to make the best of it, and
began by retrenchment from his own table. "By way of
retrenchment, I have left off wine and puddings or tarts,
and I have reduced my quantity of clean linen to wear."
Ever himself, what he spared from his own table he brought
to the poor. "We shall transcribe the simple account of this
period of his life given us by Mrs. Wykes, who knew him
from a child.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "His great charity to the poor and wandering
  beggars was unbounded. At times he gave them all
  the money he had, and stripped himself of his clothes to
  give them to the distressed; and when he had nothing to
  give, he would thank God he had only His holy truth to
  impart, and would speak of the love of God so fervently,
  that he would call forth tears from the poor objects of misery
  who came many miles to beg money or clothes of him.
  Many impostors presented themselves with the rest, but
  even those he thanked God for, and thought nothing of
  relieving them, as he said he lost nothing by them, but got
  a lesson of humility. Some poor afflicted mendicants would
  present themselves with loathsome sores, and these he would
  assist in dressing and try to cure. His house was always
  open for the distressed, and he often longed to make an hospital
  of it for the poor. He was all for gaining souls to
  God; he would often walk to Northampton to visit the
  lodging-houses, and most infamous dens of the dissolute, to
  speak to them of God's holy law and mercy to sinners.
  Indeed his whole time was devoted to doing good. He did
  not often allow himself the privilege of riding, but would
  walk to Northampton or further, carrying his clothes in a
  knapsack strapped over his shoulders, and would smile at
  the jeers and laughs against him, glorying in following out
  the practice of the Apostles. He fasted as well as he knew
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
  how, much stricter than when he became a Catholic. In
  fact he allowed nothing to himself but plain living, and
  willingly granted better to others. He gave no trouble, but
  was always ready to wait upon others, and make them
  happy and comfortable. He was always ready to hear complaints,
  and turn everything into the goodness of God. He
  was indeed the father of the poor, and a peace-maker, though
  meeting with many contradictions, particularly among the
  Dissenters. He bore all with patience and cheerfulness,
  and went on hoping all would end well in due time."
</p>
<p>
The last <i>effect</i> we shall record in this chapter is another
passage from his Journal:&mdash;"<span class="quotehead">Saturday, Nov. 17.</span> To-day I
called on Mr. Griffiths, Independent minister at Long
Buckley, with whom I had one or two hours' conversation
of a very interesting kind. I see clearly that all is not
right with the Church." He means the Church of England,
of course.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
<br>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br>
Scruples About The Athanasian Creed.</h2>
<br>
<p>
In the December of 1827 the old scruples, that came into
his head some two years before, about the Athanasian Creed
revived. Perhaps it is better to give the words of the
Journal before going into particulars on this point. He
says&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Dec. 4.&mdash;</span>.... Thursby came to
  dine and sleep here. We conversed till nearly 12, almost
  incessantly, about his concerns first, then about mine. I
  let him know my thoughts of resigning my preferment on
  account of the Athanasian Creed. He was at first very
  much displeased at them, but seemed better satisfied as I
  explained myself."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Wed., Dec. 5.&mdash;</span>I came down after a
  wakeful night, and much confirmed in my resolution to take
  decided steps about declaring against the Athanasian Creed.
  Thursby seemed to coincide much more nearly with my
  views. We talked on this and other topics until 11 or 12,
  when he went away. I went out in Great Brington till 2;
  dined; then ran to Althorp .... came back and
  wrote long letters to my father and the Bishop of Chester,
  about my intended declaration, and probable resignation of
  my living. I here solemnly affirm that before last week I
  had no sort of idea of taking this step. I am now writing
  on Friday, fully determined upon it. The circumstances
  which led me to this decision are:&mdash;1st. My many conversations
  of late, and correspondence with, dissenting ministers,
  by whose words I have been led to doubt the perfectness of
  our Establishment. 2ndly. My discussions and reflections
  about retrenchments, leading me to consider the probability
  of more preferment, and how I could accept it. 3rdly. The
  quantity of Church preferment which has been of late
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
  changing hands, by which I have been led to think how I
  should answer an offer myself. And, 4thly. My thoughts
  about signing Baily's boy's testimonial, which has led me to
  reckon more highly on the value of my signature."
</p>
<p>
From the letters of those who undertook the setting of
Mr. Spencer's troubles at rest, it appears that his difficulties
about the Athanasian Creed did not arise from the doctrines
there put forth about the Blessed Trinity and Incarnation;
but that he objected to the terminology as un-Scriptural,
and to the condemning clauses in the beginning and end of
the Creed. Dr. Blomfield is the first to reason with him;
his answer to the letter above-mentioned is couched in the
following terms:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The letter which I have just received
  from you astonishes and confounds me; not that I ought to
  be surprised at anything strange which you may do, after
  what I have lately witnessed and heard; but I must say,
  in plain terms, that your letter is the letter of an insane
  person. You profess to be willing to ask advice and hear
  reasoning, and yet you take the most decided steps to wound
  the feelings of your friends and injure the cause of the Church,
  without giving those whom you pretend to consult an opportunity
  of satisfying your doubts. You suffer your father to
  be with you two days without giving him a hint that you
  were meditating a step incomparably the most important of
  your life, and most involving his happiness; and then, in the
  midst of his security, write him a letter, not to tell him that
  you are doubtful on certain points and wish to be advised, but
  that your mind is made up and you are determined to act.
  Surely common sense and filial duty ought to have suggested
  the propriety of waiting till you had communicated with me,
  although even to me you do not state what your doubts and
  difficulties are with sufficient precision to enable me to
  discuss them; but you write a long panegyric upon your own
  sincerity and humility, of which I entertained no doubt, and
  thus, after repeated conferences with Dissenting ministers
  and Roman Catholic priests, far more astute and subtle
  reasoners than yourself, you are worked up into an utter
  disapprobation of one of the articles of our Church, having
  all along concealed your doubts from your nearest and dearest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
  friends, and from me, who had an especial claim to be made
  acquainted with them. Is this sincere and judicious conduct?"
</p>
<p>
He proceeds to some lengths in this style, then tells him
that it is one thing to doubt of the truth of a doctrine, and
another thing to believe it to be false, and that one should
take no step of importance until he thought in the latter
way. He tells him to be quiet for some time, and give him
the objections one by one. This Mr. Spencer does, and the
answer is partly, that given in Dr. Blomfield's life, page
85, and partly, another letter he wrote to him within a
fortnight's time. The argument of this good ecclesiastic
shapes itself thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The general proposition of excluding
  all from salvation who do not believe the doctrine of the
  Trinity and Incarnation, as set forth in the Athanasian
  Creed, is laid down with certain limitations. The Protestant
  Church does lay it down thus, as is evident from
  certain quotations from the Articles. Besides, she never
  intends to pronounce a condemnation on any, like the
  Church of Rome. The meaning, therefore, of these clauses
  is an assertion of the truth of the doctrine simply; and for
  this he quotes the opinion of some commissioned interpreters
  and the admission of "the most scrupulous and captious
  Baxter that such exposition may be received."
</p>
<p>
This is the sum of Dr. Blomfield's argument; he gives
several other authorities for his opinion. We need not be
surprised that the argument was not convincing; and Mr.
Spencer says, in his Journal:&mdash;"I had a letter from the
Bishop of Chester this morning, which was weak in argument
and flippant; I hope good may result from it." The
weakness of the Bishop's argument arises from the dilemma
in which he was placed. If he said the Anglican Church
does really condemn all who hold not her doctrines, then she
would arrogate to herself the claim of infallibility which she
takes good care to disclaim, and even makes an article to
that effect. If she does not condemn, what is the meaning
of allowing the clauses to remain in her formularies, and
require her ministers to subscribe, read, and preach them?
His only line of argument, considering his position, was to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
steer a middle course, and this he endeavoured to do, and
succeeded pretty well. But shifting difficulties by trying to
reconcile contradictions, is a process that may calm an easy-going
mind, previously disposed to indifference, but never
can satisfy a clear, earnest one, that seeks the truth in all
its terrible reality and straightforward meaning. A Church
composed of a mass of heterogeneous elements in doctrine and
practice, must be very hard set indeed when driven to give
an account of herself. The wonder is, that she cannot see
the absence of a Divine guidance, even in the admissions
she is forced to make, if not in the very nature of her own
human constitution. Only a Catholic can account for a
creed, and if there was not a body of living teachers with
the promise of Divine direction in their formal decisions and
utterances, the Church that Christ established would not
exist; and only Catholics can claim and prove this very
hinge of their system, which pseudo-bishops have their hits
at when they writhe under the pressure of difficulties they
cannot answer.
</p>
<p>
The letter of this Bishop did not settle Mr. Spencer's
mind&mdash;it unsettled him the more. Two or three clergymen
were invited to talk him back to the old way, but with
similar success. Lord Spencer then gets one of the London
clergy to undertake the task which foiled so many. We
give the father's letter of introduction, as it is so characteristic
of his paternal affection and concern, and at the same
time his due consideration for his son's conscientious difficulties.
The Earl was staying in Althorp for a few days,
and left this letter for George on his departure:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Your mother writes me word that Mr. Allen, of Battersea,
  will come and dine with her to-morrow, and remain
  here nearly the whole week. I am very happy at this, because,
  if you are sincere (and I do not now mean to question
  your sincerity) in wishing for information, instruction,
  and advice, I know of no man&mdash;either high or low, clerical
  or secular&mdash;more able to afford them to you, more correct in
  his doctrines and character, or more affectionately disposed
  to be of all the service he can to every one connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
  us, and to you in particular. But, my dear George, in order
  to enable yourself to derive all the benefit that may unquestionably
  be derived from serious and confidential communications
  on a most important subject, with such a man, you
  must be more explicit, more open, and more confidential
  with him than, I am grieved to think, you have yet been,
  either with your excellent friend the Bishop of Chester, or
  even with me, though I allow that in the conversations we
  have had together <i>in this visit</i> to you here, I saw rather
  more disposition to frankness on your part than I had before
  experienced.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I should not thus argue with you, my dear George, if I
  did not from my heart, as God is my judge, firmly believe
  that your welfare, both temporal and eternal, as well as the
  health both of your body and mind, depended upon your
  taking every possible means to follow a better course of
  thinking, and of study, and of occupation, than you have
  hitherto done since you have entered the profession for
  which, as I fondly hoped, and you seemed fitted by inclination,
  you would have been in due time, if well directed and
  well advised, formed to become as much an ornament to
  it as your brothers are, God Almighty be thanked for it, to
  those they have entered into.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I still venture to hope, though not without trembling,
  but I do hope and will encourage myself in the humble
  hope, which shall be daily expressed to the Almighty in my
  prayers, that I may be permitted, before I go hence, to
  witness better things of you; and I even extend my wish
  that when I return hither on Friday, I may have the satisfaction
  of learning that your interviews with Mr. Allen,
  who I have no doubt will be well prepared to hear and to
  discuss all you have to say, have had a salutary effect; and
  that our private domestic circle here may be relieved from
  the gloom which, for some time past, you must have perceived
  to overhang it when you made part of it, and afford
  us those blessings of home so comfortable and almost
  necessary to our advancing age. I write all this, because,
  perhaps, if I had had the opportunity, my spirits, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
  always very sensitive, might prevent me from speaking it.
  God bless you, my dear George.<br>
    "Your ever affectionate father,<br>
      "Spencer."
</p>
<p>
The conferences he held with this Mr. Allen are faithfully
noted in the Journal, and many and long they were. To-day
conversing, to-morrow reading Hay and Waterland together,
on the Athanasian Creed. He became no better,
but a good deal worse, and the <i>finale</i> was that he wrote to
his own Bishop, Dr. Marsh, of Peterborough, to resign his
living or have his doubts settled. This was early in the
year 1828.
</p>
<p>
This Bishop answers him thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "In reference to the
  doubts which you expressed in a former letter, you say:
  'All that I was anxious about was to avoid any just imputation
  of dishonesty, by keeping an office and emoluments
  in the Established Church, while I felt that I could not
  heartily assent to her formularies.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "If this difficulty had occurred to you when you were a
  candidate for Holy Orders, it would certainly have been your
  duty, either to wait till your doubts had been removed, or,
  if they <i>could not</i> be removed, to choose some other profession
  or employment. Whoever is persuaded that our Liturgy
  and Articles are not founded on Holy Scripture cannot
  conscientiously subscribe to the latter, or declare his assent
  to the former. To enter, therefore, on a profession which
  requires such subscription and assent, with the <i>previous
  belief</i> that such assent is not warranted by Scripture, is
  undoubtedly a sacrifice of principle made in the expectation
  of future advantage. But you did <i>not</i> make such a sacrifice
  of principle. ... Whatever doubts you <i>now</i> entertain,
  they have been imbibed since you became Rector of Brington;
  and you are apprehensive that it may be considered as
  a mark of dishonesty, if, oppressed with these difficulties,
  you retain your preferment.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I know not at present the kind or the extent of these
  difficulties, and therefore can only reply in general terms.
  I have already stated my opinion on the impropriety of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
  entering the Church with the previous belief that our
  Liturgy and Articles are not founded on Scripture. But if a
  clergyman who believed that they were so at the time of his
  ordination, and continued that belief till after he had obtained
  preferment in the Church, begins at some future
  period to entertain doubts about certain parts either of the
  Liturgy or the Articles, we have a case which presents a
  very different question from that which was considered in
  the former paragraph. In the former case there was a choice
  of professions, in the latter case there is not. By the laws
  of this country a clergyman cannot divest himself of the
  character acquired by the admission to Holy Orders. He
  can hold no office in the State which is inconsistent with the
  character of a clergyman. To relinquish preferment, therefore,
  without being able to relinquish the character by which
  that preferment was acquired, is quite a different question
  from that which relates to the original assumption of that
  character: Nor must it be forgotten that a clergyman may
  have a numerous family altogether dependent on the income
  of his benefice, whom he would bring therefore to utter ruin
  if he resigned it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "On the other hand, I do not think that even a clergyman
  so situated is at liberty to substitute his <i>own</i> doctrine for
  that to which he objects. By so doing he would directly
  impugn the Articles of our Church, he would make himself
  liable to deprivation, and would justly deserve it. For
  he would violate a solemn contract, and destroy the very
  tenure by which he holds his preferment.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But is there no medium between an open attack on our
  Liturgy and Articles and the entertaining of doubts on
  certain points, which a clergyman may communicate in confidence
  to a friend, in the hope of having them removed?
  If, in the mean time, he is unwilling to inculcate in the
  pulpit doctrines to which his doubts apply, he will at the
  same time conscientiously abstain from inculcating doctrines
  of an opposite tendency. Now, if I mistake not, this is
  precisely your case. And happy shall I be if I can be
  instrumental to the removal of the doubts which oppress you.

        "Herbert Peterborough."
</p>
<p>
This letter evoked a statement of the precise points, and
the following was the answer:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  ".... I now venture to approach the difficulties under
  which you labour, and I will take them from the words you
  yourself have used in your letter of April 30. In that
  letter, speaking of the Church, you say, 'I cannot at this
  time state any paragraph in her formularies and ordinances
  with which I cannot conscientiously comply, except the
  Athanasian Creed.' You then proceed in the following
  words: 'and now I must go on to state wherein I differ
  from this Creed: not in the parts which may be called
  doctrinal; that is, where the doctrine itself is stated and
  explained.' And you conclude by saying, 'the parts of the
  Creed to which I object are the condemning clauses.' And
  you object to the clauses on the grounds that they are not
  warranted by the declaration of our Saviour recorded in
  Mark xvi. 16, on which passage those clauses are generally
  supposed to have been founded. Whether they are so warranted
  or not depends on the extent of their application in
  this Creed, which begins with the following words:&mdash;'Whosoever
  will be saved, before all things, it is necessary that
  he hold the Catholic faith, which faith, except every one do
  keep whole and undefiled (entire and unviolated, Cath. trans.),
  without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. Now the Catholic
  faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity, and
  Trinity in Unity.' So far, then, it is evident that they only
  are declared to be excluded from salvation who do not hold
  the Catholic faith, that is, as the term is there explicitly
  defined, who do not hold the doctrine of the Trinity in
  Unity. Now this doctrine has been maintained, with very
  few exceptions, by Christians in general from the earliest to
  the present age. It was the doctrine of the Greek Church
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
  ...... and all the Reformed churches. To exclude from
  salvation, therefore, only those who reject a doctrine which
  is received by Christians in general, is a very different thing
  from the denial of salvation to every one who does not
  believe in all the tenets of a particular Church. The doctrine,
  <i>nulla salus nisi credas in Trinitatem</i>, bears no resemblance
  to the sweeping declaration <i>nulla salus extra Ecclesiam
  Romonam</i>. Surely, then, we may appeal to Mark xvi.
  16, combined with Matthew xxviii. 19, in order to prove
  that a belief in the Trinity is necessary to salvation, and
  consequently to prove that those two passages warrant the
  deduction, that they who reject the doctrine of the Trinity
  will not be saved. The two passages must be taken together,
  in order to learn the whole of our Saviour's last command
  to his Apostles. If, then, our Saviour himself commanded
  his Apostles to baptize 'in the name of the Father, and of
  the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,' and then added, 'he that
  believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth
  not shall be damned;' it really does appear that our
  Saviour himself has warranted the opinion that a belief in
  the doctrine of the Trinity is such a fundamental article
  of the Christian faith that they who reject it do so at their
  own peril.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But you think that the anathema of our Saviour in
  Mark xvi. 16, had a different application from the corresponding
  anathema in the Athanasian Creed. Our Saviour
  spoke of those to whom the Gospel had been preached, as
  appears from Mark xvi. 15. And if the anathema in the
  Athanasian Creed had a more extensive application, or if it
  were meant to include not only those who wilfully rejected
  the doctrine of the Trinity when it had been duly explained
  to them, but those also to whom the doctrine had never
  been preached, and whose want of belief arose merely from
  a want of knowledge, I should likewise admit that the
  anathema of the Athanasian Creed derived no authority
  from Mark xvi. 16. But I see no reason whatever for the
  opinion that the anathema of the Athanasian Creed includes
  those who have never heard of the doctrine. Neither
  the Creed itself, nor the circumstances under which it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
  composed, warrant such an opinion. Whoever was the
  author of it, the Creed was framed during the controversy
  which then distracted the whole of the Christian Church.
  It applied, therefore, immediately and exclusively to those
  who were partakers in or acquainted with the controversy.
  It could not have been originally intended to apply to those
  who had never heard of the controversy or the doctrine
  controverted. It would be, therefore, quite uncritical to apply
  it at present in a way which was not originally intended.
  Nor does the language of the Creed itself warrant any other
  application. When it is declared necessary to <i>hold</i> the
  Catholic faith, and to <i>keep</i> the Catholic faith, that necessity
  can apply only to those to whom the Catholic faith has
  been <i>presented</i>. Unless a man is previously put in possession
  of a thing, he cannot be said either to <i>hold</i> it or to
  <i>keep</i> it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Surely the most conscientious clergyman who believes in
  our Saviour's declaration, recorded in Mark xvi. 16, may
  read without scruple the similar declaration in the Athanasian
  Creed. And if, on the authority of our Saviour, he
  may read the anathema in the beginning of the Creed, he
  may, without scruple, read the less strongly expressed
  anathema in the end.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "In the hope that, after reading this letter, your mind
  will become at ease, I subscribe myself, dear Sir,<br>
    "Very truly yours,<br>
      "Herbert Peterborough."
</p>
<p>
This letter is a tolerable specimen of the Bishop's power
of reasoning, and very sharp it is too; but it does not
exactly meet Mr. Spencer's difficulties. He might object:&mdash;
"What passage of Scripture warrants our uniting together
the two passages from St. Mark and St. Matthew?" And
"being <i>presented with</i> a thing is not exactly the same as
<i>being in possession of</i> a thing." "We should have the
same warrant for the remaining clauses of the Creed as for
the first three, otherwise, according to the Articles, we are
not bound to receive them; then why not erase them?'
The Bishop would have no resource here, except to fall back
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
upon the Church, and that was not the point at issue; so
perhaps he did well not to try. He uses tradition, and Dr.
Blomfield authority; but these could have no weight against
a Bible Christian, as Mr. Spencer was then.
</p>
<p>
A Catholic could very easily solve the difficulty. The
Church has used these terms to express her doctrine, and
she says this is the revealed doctrine; therefore it must be.
No one can be saved who does not believe the Trinity and
Incarnation, implicitly or explicitly; those to whom it
has never been properly proposed, implicitly, and those to
whom it has, explicitly. Some theologians will have explicit
credence required of both classes, and say that God would
even send an angel to a savage, if he placed no obstacle, and
reveal this mystery to him rather than that he should die
without it. And now it will seem very strange to say
that this doctrine is less terrible than the Protestant open-arm
theory. Yet, so it is, for we allow many Socinians and
ignorant Protestants and others to be in good faith, and
perhaps never have had this doctrine properly proposed to
them. We suspend our judgments with regard to them,
and say if they live well they may be saved. That is more
than the Bishop of Peterborough could allow, according to
his principles.

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br>
Incidents And State Of Mind In 1827-28.</h2>
<br>
<p>
His life, though perpetually floating on religious discussions
and doctrinal scruples, found other matters to check its course
and employ it otherwise for a few days more. The family
were all in a great glow of delight towards the close of the
year 1827, in consequence of the Honourable Frederick
Spencer, who was commander of the <i>Talbot</i> man-of-war,
having distinguished himself at the battle of Navarino.
George, of course, was overjoyed; here was his brother, who
pored over the same lesson, played at the same games, and
contended about the same trifles as himself, crowned with
laurels and in the flush of victory. George loved him
dearly, and these well-earned honours imparted a season of
sunshine to the clergyman, which all his gospel fervour had
failed to do up to this. Lord Spencer alludes to it in the
touching letter given in a former chapter; but like everything
human, this rose had its thorns. After the letters
announcing the startling determination which called forth
the efforts of ecclesiastical learning quoted in the last
chapter, a great dulness fell over the family circle. Mr.
Allen did not clear the atmosphere, and Mr. Spencer tells
us feelingly in his Journal that his mother did not exchange
one cordial sentence with him during the whole term of her
Christmas stay at Althorp. This he felt, but bore in the
spirit of a martyr; it was inflicted upon him for what he
thought right before God, and he tried to make the best of
it, wishing, but unable, to change the aspect of things. The
Bishop of Peterborough's letter had the effect of quieting
him for some time, in so far as he did not feel himself called
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
upon to preach against what he did not assent to, but was
content with letting it remain in abeyance.
</p>
<p>
The old way of settling him is again revived. During
the last week of February, 1828, he notices three or four
long conversations about matrimony; he takes the subject
into consideration, and reads the Epistles to St. Timothy
for light: but he is not convinced, and continues in his
determination. He might foresee the settlement of ideas
that would result from this step, if he considered the trouble
of setting his money affairs in order, which forced itself
upon him now. He says: "I was employed almost all day
till three o'clock in putting my papers to rights. I feel that
I have been careless in all matters of business, and this is
wrong; for it leads me to be chargeable and dependent on
others, and that a minister especially must guard himself
against. It greatly shortens my powers of liberality, and
it makes men despise me. On all these accounts I trust I
shall overcome the evil, and be a good man of business."
He is as good as his word. He sends a full and clear account
of his affairs to his father, and his lordship makes an
arrangement that places his son in independence, whilst he
is able at the same time to get clear of all difficulties and
debts incurred by his building.
</p>
<p>
To turn to his spiritual progress. He is not a whit
nearer Catholic faith now than he was when he returned
from Italy, except that the time is shorter. On June 29 he
says: "It was St. Peter's day, and I preached on the pretensions
of the Pope." He also holdeth a tea-party in the
true Evangelical style, and says: "To-day the candle of the
Lord burnt brightly within me." He buys a mare about
this time, which does not seem to be as amenable as her
master would wish, and he says thereupon: "This mare
disappoints me rather, and puts to shame my boasting of
God's blessing in buying her. Yet I shall not be ashamed
of my faith some day or other." It was usual with him at
this time, when he had a servant to choose, a journey to take,
or anything special to get through, "to seek the Lord in
prayer therefor," and proceed according to the inspirations
he might get at the moment. Bishop Blomfield scolds him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
heartily about this, and shows him the folly of using one
faculty for a thing which God has given him another for,
and proceeding in his ordinary actions without the ordinary
means placed in his way. This was, of course, a delusion of
his; but two or three disappointments convinced him of its
being akin to tempting God.
</p>
<p>
He accompanies Dr. Blomfield in his visitation this year
also, and he gets very severely handled by him on the score
of his religious views, in the presence also of two other
clergymen. The lecture turned chiefly upon the inculcation
of humility, and the subduing of that spiritual pride which
the Bishop noticed in a former communication. A few days
after this lecture, which sank deeply into Mr. Spencer's
mind, as a whole company were seated at dinner with the
Bishop, a letter arrived from the Duke of Wellington,
announcing the translation of Dr. Blomfield from Chester to
London. This was July 25, 1828. His reflections upon
this news are: "God be praised;" and the next day he
says: "I wrote a sermon for to-morrow, and spent much
time in prayer for a quiet mind and superiority to the snares
of ambition. It was a most boisterous day, almost continual
thunder and pouring rain. I found fault with a
good deal said by the Bishop in regard to his promotion, but
I pray that I may judge myself and not others."
</p>
<p>
He now relaxes a little in his Puritanism; he gives
dinners, invites guests, and notes that he has to pray against
being too particular with regard to his guests. A pretty
large company dine at the rectory. This is an essay in
parties, and ladies are invited for the first time since he
commenced housekeeping. He had the ominous number of
thirteen at table, and it could not pass off without some
mishap or other. Contrary to old wives' rules, the servant
was the unfortunate one. We will let himself tell the story.
"Mrs. Nicholls was in great misery about breaking the
dish, which made her send up the haunch of venison upside
down. I have cause to be thankful for this, as the means
by which God will humble her. The evening passed off
well, and thank God I was not careful or shy."
</p>
<p>
He comes across a Baptist minister, who so far outdid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
him in the Methodistic way of talking, that he writes: "I
consider him a very bad specimen of cant." After this, his
outlandish gospelling comments upon trifles and iotas begin
to disappear. He becomes more rational, gets into the ways
of the world, reads newspapers, and is a very sensible kind
of man altogether. He notes in his Journal, here and there,
that he carries his own bundle, and works a part of the day
at manual labour in his garden. He also remarks that, the
coldest day he ever remembered, he went out without gloves
or great-coat, and was unable from numbness to write his
sermon when he came home. He goes on the coach next
day in the same trim, and says he wants "to give an
example to the poor," and that "God preserved him from
catching cold." Very likely he had given the great-coat to
some poor man the day before. After a few complaints of
quarrels among the clergy, and the manner in which he has
been treated by his family for the last three years on account
of his religious scruples, he concludes the year 1828 with
the following reflection:&mdash;"I now look back to this time a
year ago, and observe what I felt and wrote then, that God
only knows where I should be at present. Wondrously
am I now placed still where I was, and in all respects more
firmly settled. Yet only confirmed in my disagreement
with the powers of the Church; but they have not been
willing to attend to me, and so when my thoughts become
known, they will be more sound and influential. What I
now pray is, that I may be led to a state of heart above the
world, and may live the rest of my time always longing for
the presence of Christ, which I shall one day see. While
I abide in the flesh, may it be to no purpose but the good
of God's flock, and may I be led to suffer and to do many
and great things for His sake."
</p>
<p>
At this time he extends his correspondence to Mr. Irving,
the founder of the Irvingites, and is so struck by what that
gentleman says on the second coming of our Lord, that he
begins to prepare himself for it. He never let us know how
far he went on in this preparation.
</p>
<p>
So far is he now, February 1829, from Catholicity in his
opinions, that his father thinks it necessary to rebuke him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
for the violence of a sermon he preached on the Catholic
question; against them, of course, for his father was always
a stanch advocate of Emancipation. Little he knew that
on that day twelve months he would be a Catholic himself.
</p>
<p>
It is recorded in the Journal here, that thieves broke into
the parsonage one night. Mr. Spencer heard them; he arose,
called a servant or two, pursued the delinquents, and captured
them. This feat tells rather in favour of his bravery,
and might qualify the opinion he had of himself on this
point.
</p>
<p>
We shall give the result of the Creed question in his own
words, as given in the account of his conversion:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My scruples [about the Athanasian Creed] returned after
  a sermon which I preached on Trinity Sunday, 1827, in
  defence of that very Creed. I observed that the arguments
  by which I defended the doctrine of the Trinity itself were
  indeed founded on Scripture, but in attempting to prove to
  my hearers that a belief of this doctrine was absolutely
  necessary for man's salvation, I had recourse to arguments
  independent of Scripture, and that no passage in Scripture
  could be found which declares that whosoever will be saved
  must hold the orthodox faith on the Trinity. I had this
  difficulty on my mind for eight or nine months, after which,
  finding that I could not satisfy myself upon it, I gave notice
  to my superiors that I could not conscientiously declare my
  full assent to the Thirty-nine Articles. They attempted at
  first to satisfy me by arguments; but the more I discussed
  the subject the more convinced I became that the Article in
  question was not defensible, and after fifteen months' further
  pause, I made up my mind to leave off reading the Creed in
  the service of my Church, and informed my Bishop of my
  final resolution. Of course, he might have taken measures
  to oblige me to resign my benefice, but he thought it more
  prudent to take no notice of my letter; and thus I remained
  in possession of my place till I embraced the
  Catholic faith.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The point on which I thus found myself opposed to the
  Church of England appears a trifling one; but here was
  enough to hinder all my prospects of advancement, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
  put it in the power of the Bishop, if at any time he had
  chosen to do so, to call on me to give up my benefice. It is
  easy to conceive that under these circumstances my mind
  was set free, beyond what could be imagined in any other
  way, to follow without prejudice my researches after truth.
  I lost no opportunity of discoursing with ministers of all
  persuasions. I called upon them all to join with me in the
  inquiry where was the truth, which could be but one, and
  therefore could not be in any two contrary systems of religion,
  much less in all the variety of sects into which Christians
  are divided in England. I found little encouragement
  in any quarter to this way of proceeding, at least among
  Protestants. Those sectarians of a contrary persuasion to
  myself, to whom I proposed an inquiry with me after truth,
  I found generally ready to speak with me; but they did
  not even pretend to have any disposition to examine the
  grounds of their own principles, which they were determined
  to abide by without further hesitation. My brethren of the
  Established Church equally declined joining me in my discussions
  with persons of other persuasions, and disapproved
  of my pursuit, saying that I should never convert them to
  our side, and that I only ran the risk of being shaken
  myself. Their objections only incited me to greater diligence.
  I considered that if what I held were truth, charity
  required that I should never give over my attempts to bring
  others into the same way, though I were to labour all my
  life in vain. If, on the contrary, I was in any degree of
  error, the sooner I was shaken the better. I was convinced,
  by the numberless exhortations of St. Paul to his disciples,
  that they should be of one mind and have no divisions; that
  the object which I had before me, that is, the reunion of the
  differing bodies of Christians, was pleasing to God; and I
  had full confidence that I was in no danger of being led into
  error, or suffering any harm in following it up, as long as I
  studied nothing but to do the will of God in it, and trusted
  to His Holy Spirit to direct me.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The result of all these discussions with different sects of
  Protestants was a conviction that no one of us had a correct
  view of Christianity. We all appeared right thus far, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
  acknowledging Christ as the Son of God, whose doctrines
  and commandments we were to follow as the way to happiness
  both in time and eternity; but it seemed as if the form of
  doctrine and discipline established by the Apostles had been
  lost sight of all through the Church. I wished, therefore,
  to see Christians in general united in the resolution to find
  the way of truth and peace, convinced that God would not
  fail to point it out to them. Whether or not others would
  seek His blessing with me, I had great confidence that,
  before long, God would clear up my doubts, and therefore
  my mind was not made uneasy by them. I must here
  notice a conversation I had with a Protestant minister about
  a year before I was a Catholic, by which my views of the use
  of the Scriptures were much enlightened, and by which, as it
  will be clearly seen, I was yet farther prepared to come to a
  right understanding of the true rule of Christian faith proposed
  by the Catholic Church. This gentleman was a
  zealous defender of the authority of the Church of England
  against the various sects of Protestant Dissenters, who have
  of late years gained so much advantage against her. He
  perceived that while men were allowed to claim a right of
  interpreting the Scriptures according to their own judgment
  there never could be an end of schism; and, therefore, he
  zealously insisted on the duty of our submitting to ecclesiastical
  authority in controversies of faith, maintaining that the
  Spirit of God spoke to us through the voice of the Church,
  as well as in the written word. Had I been convinced by
  this part of his argument, it would have led me to submit to
  the Catholic Church, and not to the Church of England;
  and, indeed, I am acquainted with one young man, who
  actually became a Catholic through the preaching of this
  gentleman&mdash;following these true principles, as he was bound
  to do, to their legitimate consequences. But I did not, at
  this time, perceive the truth of the position; I yet had no
  idea of the existence of Divine, unwritten Tradition in the
  Church. I could imagine no way for the discovery of the
  truth but persevering study of the Scriptures, which, as
  they were the only Divine rule of faith with which I was
  acquainted, I thought must of course be sufficient for our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
  guidance, if used with an humble and tractable spirit; but
  the discourse of this clergyman led me at least to make an
  observation which had never struck my mind before as being
  of any importance,&mdash;namely, that the system of religion
  which Christ taught the Apostles, and which they delivered
  to the Church, was something distinct from our volume of
  Scriptures. The New Testament I perceived to be a collection
  of accidental writings, which, as coming from the pens
  of inspired men, I was assured must, in every point, be
  agreeable to the true faith; but they neither were, nor anywhere
  professed to be, a complete and systematic account of
  Christian faith and practice. I was, therefore, in want of
  some further guidance on which I could depend. I knew
  not that it was in the Catholic Church that I was at length
  to find what I was in search of; but every Catholic will see,
  if I have sufficiently explained my case, how well I was
  prepared to accept with joy the direction of the Catholic
  Church, when once I should be convinced that she still
  preserved unchanged and inviolate the very form of faith
  taught by the Apostles, the knowledge of which is, as it
  were, the key to the right and sure interpretation of the
  written word."
</p>
<p>
It was in April, 1829, that he wrote the letter to the
Bishop which was not taken notice of. He next withdrew
his name from some societies&mdash;such as the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge, &amp;c. This act so displeased
Dr. Blomfield, that he writes to say Mr. Spencer is no longer
his chaplain. At the suggestion of some member of his
family, he wrote an apology, and was restored again to favour
and to his office. On May 22, 1829, the Journal suddenly
breaks off, and he did not resume it again until the 1st of
May, 1846. The events of the seventeen years intervening
can be gathered from his correspondence, though, perhaps,
not with the precision that would be desirable.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
<br>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br>
The Maid Of Lille.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Incidents overlapped each other so thickly, and were of
such different tendencies during the last two years of Mr.
Spencer's life as a minister, that we have judged it better to
give them singly, even at the expense of a little sacrifice of
the order of time. One of these, and an important one, is
selected for the subject of this chapter. On the 23rd of
November, 1827, just before his Athanasian scruples had
risen to their height, as he returned from his pastoral
visitation, he found a letter, purporting to be from a gentleman
in Lille, "who was grievously troubled about the arguments
for Popery." This letter contains little more than a
statement of tendencies towards Catholicity in the writer,
with extracts from Papin, <i>De la Tolrance des Protestants</i>,
to account for them. The extracts draw a parallel between
the Church and a well-regulated kingdom, in many of her
doctrines and chief points of her discipline. It was anonymous,
and reasons were assigned for withholding the writer's
name. Mr. Spencer, ever anxious to counsel the doubtful,
lost no time in answering, and sent off a long letter to his
unknown friend by that evening's post. It was shortly
after this that he wrote the letters to his father and Dr.
Blomfield about the resignation of his preferment, and
whether the Lille letter had anything to do with increasing
his doubts, or not, is a question. It had, however, one effect:
it made him anxious to find out what kind of people
Catholics were; and an incident that occurred about the
same time aided this curiosity. There were some soldiers
quartered in Northampton, and, as Mr. Spencer was talking
to some of the officers in the court-yard of the barracks, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
Catholic priest entered, to look after such of the soldiers as
might require his spiritual care. He saw the priest, and
spoke to him; and, finding out the object of his mission,
kindly introduced him to one of the officers, who, in
consideration of Mr. Spencer, got all due attention paid to the
priest; and the good parson was assured that he succeeded
to his satisfaction before he left the place. A few days
afterwards he met the priest, who thanked him for his
charity, and said it was Providence sent him there at such
a time, and arranged that his duty could be discharged
among the soldiers with ease and honour, which had often-times
to be done amid insults, or at least coldness on the
part of the military authorities. Mr. Spencer began to
think, "Really these Papists believe in Providence!" This
wonderful discovery made him think they believed a little
more also, and that they were not quite such idolaters as he
had been taught to suppose. Another letter from the Lille
correspondent confirmed him in this, and shook him in many
of his older notions. He dines, in a few days after this despatch,
with the celebrated Dr. Fletcher and a Miss Armytage, at
Lady Throckmorton's. He has a long conversation with the
last of the Douay controversialists after dinner; but the
only effect produced is this: "I am thankful for the kindness
of both those Papists. The Lord reward them by
showing them His truth." He invites Dr. Fletcher to dinner
at Brington&mdash;a favour the Doctor avails himself of on the
27th March, 1828. Another letter from his friend at Lille
makes him acknowledge that he has not had proper notions
of Catholicity; in his own words: "I expected easily to
convince him that the Catholic Church was full of errors;
but he answered my arguments. ....  I discovered
by means of this correspondence that I had never duly
considered the principles of our Reformation; that my objections
to the Catholic Church were prejudices adopted from
the sayings of others, not the result of my own observation.
Instead of gaming the advantage in this controversy, I saw,
and I owned to my correspondent, that a great change had
been produced in myself. I no longer desired to persuade
him to keep in the communion of the Protestant Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
but rather determined and promised to follow up the same
inquiries with him, if he would make his name known to
me, and only pause awhile before he joined the Catholics.
But I heard no more of him till after my conversion and
arrival at Rome, when I discovered that my correspondent
was a lady, who had herself been converted a short
time before she wrote to me. I never heard her name before, [Footnote 7]
nor am I aware that she had ever seen my person; but
God moved her to desire and pray for my salvation, which
she also undertook to bring about in the way I have related.
I cannot say that I entirely approve of the stratagem to
which she had recourse, but her motive was good, and God
gave success to her attempt: for it was this which first
directed my attention particularly to inquire about the
Catholic religion, though she lived not to know the accomplishment
of her wishes and prayers. She died at Paris, a year
before my conversion, when about to take the veil as a nun of
the Sacred Heart; and I trust I have in her an intercessor
in Heaven, as she prayed for me so fervently on earth."
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 7: The lady's name was Miss Dolling.]
</p>
<p>
This was the last of F. Ignatius's romances, and a beautiful
one it was. As it may be interesting to see what was in those
famous letters, we think it well to give a few extracts:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  The line of the lady's argument is this. That Scripture
  without Tradition is quite insufficient for salvation. We
  cannot know anything about the Scriptures themselves,
  their composition, inspiration, interpretation, without
  Tradition. Besides the New Testament was not the text-book
  of the Apostles&mdash;it is a collection of some things they
  were inspired to write for the edification of the first
  Christians and others who had not seen our Lord; and the
  Epistles are a number of letters from inspired men bound
  up together in one volume. The body of doctrine, with its
  bearings, symmetry, extent, and obligation, was delivered
  orally by the Apostles, and the Epistles must be consonant
  to that system as well as explanatory of portions of it.
  Only by the unbroken succession of pastors from the
  Apostles to the present time, can we have any safeguard as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
  to what we are to believe, and how we are to believe. The
  Apostles and their successors were "to teach all nations,"
  and Christ promised them and them alone the unerring
  guidance of the Holy Spirit. She then assigns to tradition
  the office of bearing testimony to what the doctrines of the
  Church have been, and are at present. The definitions of
  Councils are simple declarations that such and such is the
  belief then and from the beginning of the Catholic Church.
  They state what is, not invent what is to be. Now history,
  or written tradition, as contra-distinguished from Scripture,
  testifies to every single tenet of the Catholic Church&mdash;her
  creeds, liturgy, sacraments, jurisdiction. It testifies unerringly,
  too, even from the objections of heretics, to the fact
  that this Church has been always believed divine in her
  origin, divine in her teaching, infallible and unerring in her
  solemn pronouncements. This is fact, and who can gainsay
  it?
</p>
<p>
This peculiar way of arguing, by making tradition or history
bear witness to the existence of the Church, as well as
to what she always declared to be her doctrine, is a very
felicitous shape to cast her arguments into. It draws the
line between faith and the evidence of faith. Evidence,
human evidence of the first grade of moral certainty, says:
The Church believed this, and that, and the other, at such
and such times, and not as a new, but as an old doctrine, that
came down from age to age since the Apostles. The same
evidence says: that she believed them as revealed by God,
and that she could not be mistaken on account of His promise.
That she never swerved, and never will swerve, from
one single article which she has once believed. If this Church
be not <i>The Church</i> of Christ, I ask you where is it to be
found?
</p>
<p>
In the second letter she says:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "After much reflection I must confess to you their
  system appears reasonable, natural, and convincing. With
  us, they consider the Holy Scriptures as the most respectable
  testimony of our faith, and they profess a strict adherence
  to them; they have for them the greatest respect;
  and the Catholic priests support from the Bible what they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
  teach the people, and I am certain that they study and
  understand the Scriptures as much as our ministers. The
  principal difference I remark is, that they do not undertake
  to interpret them according to their own opinions: they
  say that the inspired writings are replete with mysteries,
  which the eye of man cannot penetrate; and that He alone
  who gave them is able to comprehend their sublimity;
  consequently, to follow the impulse of reason in explaining
  them, would be incurring the danger of falling into error,
  and leading others into the same path. For this cause the
  Catholic minister will not suffer the Holy Scriptures to be
  separated from the instruction of their predecessors up to
  the Apostles; not that they by any means give the word
  of man precedence to the Word of God, since they believe
  that man alone cannot explain it, for 'who,' they ask,
  'assisted at the council of the Almighty?' But they
  believe that those who heard the Apostles preach, understood
  the true meaning of their words; and that their immediate
  successors, <i>especially</i>, educated by them, and who
  taught the Gospel during the life of their instructors, necessarily
  understood the meaning of their writings, the doctrine
  of which was undoubtedly conformable to what they
  taught verbally. ...."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "St. Paul, in his Epistles to the Colossians, informs us
  that the Gospel was preached to all the world. This being
  the case, I see no possibility of introducing any new doctrine.
  The Apostles threatened with eternal punishment
  those who did not believe what they taught in the name of
  Jesus Christ. And whoever would have the temerity to
  add to the primitive doctrine they visited with a like
  anathema. Tell me, now, how could the Church have
  introduced such a doctrine as that of the Real Presence,
  after a priest has pronounced the words, "This is my
  body"? How is it possible that the faithful could reconcile
  themselves to the idea of acknowledging and adoring Jesus
  Christ present on the altar, as He was in the manger at
  Bethlehem, and as He is in Heaven at the right hand of His
  Father, if this doctrine had not always been received and
  believed as it is at present by the Roman Catholic Church?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
  Christians who knew the value of salvation could not so
  easily be deceived; several among them would have remonstrated
  against this superstition and idolatry. Do we find
  that they have done so?"
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I imagine myself in idea at the period of the Reformation,
  and consider the belief and customs of that time. All
  Europe, the provinces of Asia and Africa which had not
  embraced Mahomedanism, admitted and believed the contrary
  to what Calvin taught, especially concerning the
  Lord's Supper. I should be glad to hear your impartial
  opinion on this subject. Where did Calvin find this doctrine?
  As I observe, he did not learn it in the schools,
  nor in any book, nor in his own family, nor in the temple
  of God; the innovation was universally opposed; a million
  voices remonstrated against his impiety. What right had
  he to be believed? He proposed only the interpretation
  which <i>he</i> gave to the words of Jesus Christ, <i>This is my
  body</i>. He supported his opinion in no other way, he proved
  it by no miracles, and therefore did not deserve belief,
  since he gave no proofs of a divine mission. He was but a
  man, and, what is more, one of whom historians do not
  speak as being virtuous. Tell me, then, how can I acknowledge
  that he possessed the Holy Spirit, knew the meaning
  of Scripture. .... listen to and follow a young man
  in his opinion and oppose the rest of the world. Could
  that be wisdom?
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But supposing, my dear sir, the Church to be in error,
  or even liable to err, how can we possibly profess to believe
  any mystery? For to have faith, it is impossible to doubt
  or hesitate. And if I believe not, I am lost. I am already
  condemned. 'He that believeth not is already judged.'
  If the Church be liable to error, may I not reply to our
  ministers:&mdash;'I doubt the truth of what you preach: I am
  not obliged to believe you'? You tell me I am not obliged
  to believe what <i>you</i> so charitably wrote to me, and many
  passages of which letter have sensibly affected me: to
  whom, then, must I have recourse? You give me reason
  to conclude that you are not certain of the assistance of the
  Holy Ghost, as you do not oblige me to believe what you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
  say, but you desire me to compare your words with the
  Scriptures, and to reject them if I don't find them conformable
  to the Word of God. How can I imagine myself more
  certain than you that I rightly interpret them, or that I
  have the assistance of Heaven? I must continue to doubt
  during the rest of my life, and remain an unbeliever.

  "You say, 'if a man will do His will, he shall know
  of the doctrine whether it be of God.' To do the will of

<p>
She quotes several authorities bearing witness in their
day that the supremacy of the Pope was then believed to be
of divine right, and closes the list with Sir Thomas More.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "By the grace of God I have always professed the Catholic
  religion. Having, however, often heard the power of the
  Pope was of human institution, I resolved to weigh the
  matter without, at the same time, injuring my faith. For
  seven years I followed up this study: I drank at the fountain
  head: I went to the origin of things. At length I found
  that the pontifical power is not only useful and necessary&mdash;
  but, strictly lawful and of divine appointment. ..."

<p class="cite">
  "I cannot admit the system of <i>particular</i> inspiration,
  since I see many, pretending to be inspired, fall into manifest

</p>
<p>
The third letter is partly a continuation of the second,
and partly on a new plan; so a few extracts from it must
be welcome, especially as it really did such work upon poor
Mr. Spencer's mind.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  .... "It is certain that Jesus Christ founded a
  Church upon earth for the salvation of man; where, then,
  is it? This is certainly the whole question among the
  different sects opposed to each other. .... I must
  necessarily enter the true Church, for I cannot be saved in
  that which is false. ....
</p>
<p class="cite">
  .... "I am persuaded the Catholics do not found
  their belief on the opinions and interpretations of men;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
  their authority is Jesus Christ, God Himself; certainly that
  must be infallible, and the reason of man ought to bend to
  it. They believe in such and such doctrines because Jesus
  Christ and His Apostles taught them; this is the simple and
  reasonable motive of their faith. The doctrine of Jesus'
  and His Apostles is not an opinion, but a fact, which I see
  so completely proved by an assemblage of facts and circumstances
  so striking, that, not to be convinced of its truth,
  would be to renounce all common sense. .... The
  fact that the Catholic Church is in possession of the true
  doctrine is a fact proved like all other historical facts; it is
  proved by a weight of testimony given by persons who saw
  and heard themselves. Observe, it is not the opinions or
  interpretations given by those persons which are advanced
  as proofs, as you suppose in your letter; but all these holy
  persons have shed their blood to support and defend the
  truth, not of their opinions, but of what they have seen or
  heard. I can understand that fanaticism would induce a
  man to sacrifice his life to support a favourite opinion, but
  it has never yet been seen that any one would lose his life
  to prove that he had seen or heard things which he, in fact,
  had not. Tradition is not, therefore, as you suppose, the
  opinions and interpretations of the Fathers, but their testimony
  to what they saw, heard, taught, and practised. In
  the same way, the general Councils have fixed the sense of
  Scripture only by declaring the fact that such has been the
  universal doctrine since the Apostles. It is the assemblage
  of these proofs that brings conviction to the soul; they must
  all be seen united and compared, and this is undoubtedly a
  laborious study.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The Catholics believe that their Church is in possession
  of the doctrine taught by Christ, and listen to it as they
  would to Him. Judge from this how strong and lively must
  be the faith of a Catholic, how firm and immovable, since
  the voice of their Church is the voice of their Saviour, and
  the interval of eighteen hundred years disappears as they
  every day hear the voice of Jesus. There cannot be any
  division in this Church. It being an historical fact that the
  same doctrine has been taught from the beginning by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
  infallible mouth of Jesus Christ and His Apostles, it follows
  that <i>all</i> must yield to that authority, and that the rash

  Jesus Christ, and consequently ought to be driven from the
  flock. ....

<p class="cite">
  "You are in error as to the Pope if you suppose that
  formerly, or now, Catholics give him their faith, as Calvinists
  do to Calvin, &amp;c. I thought the same. The Pope is
  simply the chief administrator; the doctrines he has the
  stewardship of do not come from him or any other Pope, as
  that of Calvinism from Calvin; it comes from Jesus Christ,
  from His Apostles, and from their churches throughout the
  world. An administrator is not the master of the doctrines
  with which he is entrusted. The Pope and Bishops
  are charged to preserve the doctrine, to propagate it and

  "You interpret the text, 'lo! I am with you <i>always</i>,'

  of the passage must be considered. It was not to every one
  He addressed these words; it was only to His Apostles that
  He said, 'Go and teach all nations .... behold, I am
  with you.' From this it is clearly to the Apostles and their
  successors that He promised the Holy Spirit. I see in these
  words that they received from God himself the formal order
  or mission to go and preach, not what they found written,
  but what He had taught. .... I see also by these words
  that sovereigns of this world have not received the power
  of sending ministers to teach the Gospel, and certainly by
  so doing they usurp the power given to the Apostles and
  their successors. What we have to find is, to whom God
  has said, 'Go and teach.' It is physically impossible that
  it should concern our ministers, since they are established
  by temporal authority."

<p>
About the Reformers she says:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Can man reform the work of his Creator?"
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "You say you will never claim any name but that of
  Christian, but still it is not with you a matter of indifference
  what communion you belong to; therefore, this being
  the case, it is not sufficient to bear the name of Christian,
  and say we trust in Jesus; we must be sure that the doctrines
  we adopt are really his. For it is not being a
  Christian to embrace doctrines contrary to those given by
  our Saviour; it is assuming the name of Christian without
  being certain we are so; we must find if we are in communion
  with His Church. Without faith there is no salvation;
  this cannot mean a faith of our own choosing, but what
  God has been pleased to command we should believe. ....
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Many of our ministers are ignorant or wicked enough
  to accuse Catholics of idolatry. It is Jesus Christ they
  adore really present though invisible in the Eucharist.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
  render their faith more lively, and to induce them thereby
  to adore God the more truly in spirit and in truth."
</p>
<p>
These are arguments of no little strength, to say the least
of them. It would be a pleasure to transcribe the letters <i>in
extenso</i>, but the three cover thirty-two pages of
closely-written letter-paper, and would consequently take up too
much room in a biography. Some sceptically-inclined person
will probably say,&mdash;"she had some Jesuit or other
astute Romish priest at her elbow when she wrote these
letters." The writer can only tell his reader that he verily
suspects as much himself. But before any of us jump at a
conclusion, it might be well to consider this sentence which
occurs towards the end of the third letter.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Do not think
  I am under the influence of some priests who have induced
  me to undertake this examination. It was a lawyer first

  you pray for it as the free gift of God; and to obtain this
  you must be humble, your conscience must be as pure as
  you can make it: God alone can be your help; pray to Him
  unceasingly."

However we may think about their real author, the
matter itself is very good, and their consequence to Mr.
Spencer was of vital importance. There are no rough
copies of his answers to the unknown to be found among his
papers, or it would be very interesting to place them side by
side with what we have quoted. The result of these letters
we have in his account of his conversion:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "After this period I entertained the opinion that the
  Reformers had done wrong in separating from the original
  body of the Church; at any rate, I was convinced that
  Protestants who succeeded them were bound to make a reunion
  with it. I still conceived that many errors and corruptions
  had been introduced among Catholics, and I did
  not imagine that I could ever conform to their faith, or join
  in their practices, without some alterations on their part;
  but I trusted that the time might not be distant when God
  would inspire all Christians with a spirit of peace and concord,
  which would make Protestants anxiously seek to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
  re-united to their brethren, and Catholics willing to listen
  to reason, and to correct those abuses in faith, and discipline
  which kept their brethren from joining them. To the procuring
  such a happy termination to the miserable schisms
  which had rent the Church, I determined to devote my
  life. I now lost no opportunity of conversations with Protestants
  and Catholics. My object with both was to awaken
  them to a desire of unity with each other; to satisfy myself
  the more clearly where was the exact path of truth in
  which it was desirable that we should all walk together;
  and then to persuade all to correct their respective errors
  in conformity with the perfect rule, which I had no doubt
  the Lord would in due time point out to me, and to all who
  were ready to follow His will disinterestedly. I thought
  that when Catholics were at length willing to enter with
  me on these discussions with candour, they would at once
  begin to see the errors which to me appeared so palpable in
  their system: but I was greatly surprised to find them all
  so fixed in their principles, that they gave me no prospect
  of re-union except on condition of others submitting unreservedly
  to them; and, at the same time, I could see in their
  ordinary conduct and manner of disputing with me nothing
  to make one suspect them of insincerity, or of want of
  sufficient information of the grounds of their belief. These
  repeated conversations increased more and more my desire
  to discover the true road, which I saw that I, at least for
  one, was ignorant of: but I still imagined that I could see
  such plain marks of difference between the Catholic Church
  of the present day and the Church of the primitive ages as
  described in Scripture, that I repeatedly put aside the
  impression which the arguments of Catholics, and, yet more,
  my observation of their character, made upon me, and I
  still held up my head in the controversy."

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br>
Ambrose Lisle Phillipps.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The close and warm friendship between Father Ignatius
and Mr. Phillipps has scarcely a parallel in ancient or
modern history. They became acquainted in 1829; and
until death suspended their mutual communication for
awhile, they ever wrote, spoke, and thought, with more than
a brotherly&mdash;ay, more than any human or natural affection.
The Christian patriotism of each, which prayed and laboured
to bring their countrymen to the blessings they themselves
had received, may have fostered this beautiful love; and
even the different spheres in, as well as means by, which they
felt themselves called to prosecute the work of their predilection
may have helped to keep it ever warm and new;
but there was a something in it which reminds one of David
and Jonathan, that spread over it a grace and splendour far
above what it is given us now and then to behold. This
chapter will show the rise of their mutual affection, and
show where lay the basis of the edifice gratitude and charity
helped to fashion.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius says, in the account of his conversion:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Near the end of the year 1829 I was introduced to
  young Mr. Phillipps, eldest son of a rich gentleman in
  Leicestershire, whom I had often heard spoken of as a convert
  to the Catholic religion. I had for a long time been
  curious to see him, that I might observe the mode of reasoning
  by which he had been persuaded into what I still
  thought so great an error. We spent five hours together
  in the house of the Rev. Mr. Foley, Catholic Missionary in
  my neighbourhood, with whom I had already had much
  intercourse. I was interested by the ardent zeal of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
  young man in the cause of his faith. I had previously
  imagined that he must have been ignorant on the subject of
  religion, and that he had suffered himself to be led blindly
  by others; but he answered all my objections about his own
  conversion with readiness and intelligence. I could not but
  see that it had been in him the result of his own diligent
  investigations. I was delighted with what I could observe
  of his character. I was more than ever inflamed with a
  desire to be united in communion with persons in whom I saw
  such clear signs of the Spirit of God; but yet my time was
  not fully come. I fancied, by his conversation, that he had
  principles and ideas inconsistent with what I had learned
  from Scripture; and in a few days I again put aside the
  uneasiness which this meeting had occasioned, and continued
  to follow my former purpose, only with increased resolution
  to come at satisfaction. He was, in the meanwhile, much
  interested in my case. He recommended me to the prayers of
  some religious communities, and soon after invited me to his
  father's house that we might continue our discourses. I
  was happy at the prospect of this meeting, and full of hopes
  that it would prove satisfactory to me; but I left home
  without any idea of the conclusion to which it pleased God
  to bring me so soon."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Phillipps wrote to him:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My Dear Sir,&mdash;We expect the Bishop of Lichfield
  here on the 25th January, and I have ventured to hope
  that I might be able to induce you to come here at that
  time, to meet him and stay the week. I hope so the more,
  as I think your conversation might induce him, as well as
  my father, to think more seriously on that awful subject on
  which we conversed when I had the great happiness of being
  introduced to you at Northampton. I assure you, a day
  has not passed without my offering up my unworthy prayers
  to Almighty God in your behalf; and I cannot refrain from
  again saying, that I hope one day we shall be united in the
  same faith of the One Holy and Apostolic Church of Jesus
  Christ. How great is the consolation to belong to that
  holy Church which alone Jesus Christ has founded, which
  alone He has illustrated with a never-failing succession of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
  pastors and of miracles, from which all others have separated,
  and out of which I find in the Holy Scriptures no covenanted
  promise of salvation! The Catholic Church alone has converted
  those nations which have been brought to the faith of
  Christ; and as, on the one hand, no man could at this
  moment be a Protestant had not Luther and the other
  Reformers existed, so, on the other, neither Luther nor any
  succeeding Protestant could derive any knowledge of Christianity
  but from the Catholic Church. How sublime are
  the promises of Christ, 'Upon this Rock I will build My
  Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.'
  .... 'Going, therefore, teach ye all nations.' ....
  'And lo! I am with you all days, even unto the end of the
  world.' Now to what Church was this promise made (a
  promise which involves infallibility; for it would be blasphemy
  to say that the God of Truth could commission a
  Church to teach the world, if that Church could possibly teach
  error)? Certainly not to Churches (sects, I should say) which
  separated from the parent Church fifteen hundred years after
  the promise was given, and therefore came into existence
  fifteen hundred years too late to be the Church of Christ.
  And to what do the sects have recourse? To groundless
  accusations of the Church of God, involving the charge of
  idolatry; but this very charge condemns them, '<i>ex ore tuo
  judico te</i>.' for, by saying that the Church fell into idolatry,
  and that that justifies their separation, they admit that
  there was a time when the Church was not guilty of idolatry.
  Now how are the promises of Christ verified, if His
  Church could ever become idolatrous? I find in no part of
  Scripture any prediction that the Church of Christ should
  ever become idolatrous, and that then it should be lawful to
  separate from her. Christ said simply, 'I am with you all
  days,' and 'he that believeth and is baptised shall be saved,
  and he that believeth not shall be condemned.' It is in
  vain to urge that St. Paul speaks of the 'man of sin,' and
  of 'a falling away,'&mdash;he speaks not of the Church; and the
  very expression 'a falling away' shows that it is not the
  Church, but sects, to which he alludes&mdash;for the Church
  never fell away from any previous Church,&mdash;this is matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
  history; but all the sects, all schismatics, all heretics, fell
  away from the Catholic Church of Christ,&mdash;this is equally
  matter of history. No. St. Paul, the ever-glorious apostle
  and doctor of the Gentiles, spoke of Arius, Luther, Calvin,
  Knox, and Henry VIII., and all other heresiarchs, all of
  whom did apostatize and 'fall away,' and have by their
  schisms and endless divisions, and the spirit of infidelity
  resulting from them, paved the way for the Man of Sin, the
  great Antichrist, who may perhaps shortly appear, the last
  development of Heresy and Liberalism. But how shall
  sectaries take refuge in the mysterious predictions of the
  Apocalypse? As well might that atrocious assassin who
  killed Henry IV. find some excuse in the hidden words
  of that volume. But I might pursue the question still
  further. What right have sects to the Bible? Jesus
  Christ gave it to us, and these men have stolen our book. If
  they say He did not give it to us, I reply, then they ought
  to cease to believe that Jesus Christ ever existed, for that is
  no more a matter of history, nor a more certain fact, than
  His commission to His Church to teach all nations all truth.

Althorp, where the family were assembled, as usual, for the
Christmas holidays.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Althorp, <i>Jan</i>. 4, 1830.
<br><br>
  "My Dear Sir,&mdash;I received your kind invitation to
  Garendon on Saturday; but I thought it best to postpone
  answering it for a day or two, that I might consider what I
  had better do. If the visit which you propose to me had
  been an ordinary one, I suppose I should have declined it
  for the present, as I believe my father and mother will be
  at Althorp till about the 25th January, and I seldom go
  out when they are here. But as you invite me in the hope,
  and with a desire, that good may be done by my going, I
  believe I should be sorry afterwards if I refused. I therefore
  have told my father of my intention, and, if nothing
  happens to prevent me, I will be with you on Monday the
  25th. As to the hour of my arrival, I cannot just now tell
  how the coaches run between Northampton and Loughborough;
  but I conclude I shall be with you in good time.
  And now that I have determined to go, I am really thankful
  that another opportunity of conversing with you is given
  me so soon; and I trust that our intercourse will be blessed
  for our own good and that of others. And if the step you
  have taken in becoming a Roman Catholic is correct, according
  to the will of Christ, I have no doubt that my conversation
  with you will be of use in drawing me nearer to the
  right point. If, as I still am convinced, there is some error
  in your views, let us agree in hoping that our intercourse
  may be likewise profitable to you. I have been confirmed,
  by every conversation which I have had with Roman Catholics,
  in the persuasion that there is something materially
  wrong in what we may call the Protestant system; and I
  have spoken my mind to this effect as often as occasion has
  been given me. But if our union with the Roman Catholic
  Church involves a declaration of my belief of all that she
  teaches, and a submission to all her authority, as their subjects
  are set forth in Bossuet's Exposition and Catechism, I
  am not as yet one of the body; and I am reduced to the
  conviction that somewhere or other there is an error among
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
  you. One thing I have learnt in the course of these inquiries
  is that the Scriptures of the New Testament are not,
  as I formerly used to regard them through want of consideration,
  the formal canon of the Christian faith. It is as
  clear to me as I suppose you could wish it to be, that the
  oral tradition of Christ to Peter and the other Apostles, and
  that of the Apostles to the Churches, is the rule of Christian
  doctrine, and with all my heart I seek for the knowledge of
  what they taught, and have been frequently struck with the
  desirableness of a clear and definite authority to which we
  might refer, when I have observed the mischief into which
  Christians have fallen by following each his own judgment.
  I do not see how I should be stopped from at once becoming
  Catholic, under this impression, if it was not that on comparing
  the state of the doctrine and discipline of the Roman
  Church with what the Scriptures plainly teach me of the state
  of the Apostolic Church, and the method of their doctrine, I
  see such an obvious and plain difference, and I cannot be convinced
  but that, between their time and that of the Council of
  Trent, improper use has been made of the Church's authority.
  I am waiting to learn what is the right way, which
  God knows and He alone; and I can only hope for His
  guidance of me into the right way by standing ready for conviction
  when the means of it are offered to me. I declare
  myself to be in doubt. But that doubt gives me no uneasiness,
  for my hope of salvation is simply founded on Jesus
  Christ crucified; whom I expect to meet, as one of His
  redeemed ones, when He returns. It is not any works of
  righteousness which I can do, nor any outward profession of
  doctrine which I can make, that can justify me. I am
  justified freely by the grace of God through faith in Jesus
  Christ, to whom I give myself, to learn of Him and follow
  Him whithersoever He leadeth. You will find me as open
  to instruction and conviction as you seemed to think me at
  Mr. Foley's; and I will weigh what you say, though you
  should decline to meet me on the same terms, and declare
  yourself determined to give your mind no more to inquiry.
  Yet, for your own sake and the sake of others, who will of
  course be more disposed to attend to you if they see you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
  candid and still humble and doubtful of your own judgment,
  I wish you to resolve that you will meet me as I come to
  you, determined that we will, with the blessing of God,
  come to one mind, at the cost of all our respective prejudices.
  We should not meet as polemics determined on
  victory, but in the spirit of meekness and mutual forbearance.
  Then God, who sees the heart, if he sees us truly
  thus disposed, will know how to make his truth shine
  clearly to us both. Above all, let us pray for each other,
  and for all, but especially those who most nearly belong to
  us, and be encouraged by the promise, 'If any two of you
  shall agree as touching anything that ye shall ask, on earth
  it shall be done for them of My Father, who is in heaven.'
  Pray give my respectful compliments to your father, whom
  I remember well meeting once at Brock Hall, and of whom I
  have often heard the Thorntons speak with great regard;
  and to carry to him my best thanks for his kind permission
  to you to receive me in his house. Perhaps I shall write to
  the Bishop of Lichfield, to tell him that I expect to meet
  him there. I hope nothing will prevent his coming. And
  if we are allowed to have freedom of conversation with him
  on these things, which I pray to God may be given us, I
  must particularly interest you to hear and consider what he
  says with meekness and humility, though you may have the
  clearest conviction that he is in error. Surely his age and
  rank, and the work to which he has sincerely devoted himself,
  and his relation to you, make this a double duty; and,
  by acting so, you will not be hurt, for though you may be
  perplexed for awhile, God will not suffer you to lose one
  point of what is really good, but will finally establish you
  the more firmly for acting in this humble spirit.<br>

      "Yours most sincerely,<br>

He relates, in the <i>Account of his Conversion</i>, the effects
of this visit:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "On Sunday, 24th January, 1830, I preached in my
  church, and in the evening took leave of my family for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
  week, intending to return on the Saturday following to my
  ordinary duties at home. But our Lord ordered better for
  me. During the week I spent on this visit I passed many
  hours daily in conversation with Phillipps, and was satisfied
  beyond all my expectations with the answers he gave to the
  different questions I proposed, about the principal tenets and
  practices of Catholics. During the week we were in company
  with several other Protestants, and among them some
  distinguished clergymen of the Church of England, who
  occasionally joined in our discussions. I was struck with
  observing how the advantage always appeared on his side
  in the arguments which took place between them, notwithstanding
  their superior age and experience; [Footnote 8]
  and I saw how
  weak was the cause in behalf of which I had hitherto been
  engaged; I felt ashamed of arguing any longer against what
  I began to see clearly could not be fairly disproved. I now
  openly declared myself completely shaken, and, though I
  determined to take no decided step until I was entirely
  convinced, I determined to give myself no rest till I was
  satisfied, and had little doubt now of what the result would
  be. But yet I thought not how soon God would make the
  truth clear to me. I was to return home, as I have said,
  on Saturday. Phillipps agreed to accompany me on the day
  previous to Leicester, where we might have further conversation
  with Father Caestryck, the Catholic missionary established
  in that place. I imagined that I might take some
  weeks longer for consideration, but Mr. Caestryck's conversation
  that afternoon overcame all my opposition. He
  explained to me, and made me see, that the way to come at
  the knowledge of the true religion is not to contend, as men
  are disposed to do, about each individual point, but to submit
  implicitly to the authority of Christ, and of those to
  whom He has committed the charge of His flock. He set
  before me the undeniable but wonderful fact of the agreement
  of the Catholic Church all over the world, in one faith,
  under one head; he showed me the assertions of Protestants,
  that the Catholic Church had altered her doctrines, were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
  not supported by evidence; he pointed out the wonderful,
  unbroken chain of the Roman Pontiffs; he observed to me
  how in all ages the Church, under their guidance, had
  exercised an authority, undisputed by her children, of cutting
  off from her communion all who opposed her faith and
  disobeyed her discipline. I saw that her assumption of this
  power was consistent with Christ's commission to His
  Apostles to teach all men to the end of the world; and His
  declaration that those who would not hear the pastors of
  His Church rejected Him. What right, then, thought I,
  had Luther and his companions to set themselves against
  the united voice of the Church? I saw that he rebelled
  against the authority of God when he set himself up as an
  independent guide. He was bound to obey the Catholic
  Church&mdash;how then should I not be equally bound to return
  to it? And need I fear that I should be led into error by
  trusting to those guides to whom Christ himself thus directed
  me? No! I thought this impossible. Full of these impressions,
  I left Mr. Caestryck's house to go to my inn,
  whence I was to return home next morning. Phillipps
  accompanied me, and took this last occasion to impress on
  me the awful importance of the decision which I was called
  upon to make. At length I answered:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 8: Phillipps was then about 17 years of age.]
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'I am overcome. There is no doubt of the truth.
  One more Sunday I will preach to my congregation, and
  then put myself into Mr. Foley's hands, and conclude this
  business.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It may be thought with what joyful ardour he embraced
  this declaration, and warned me to declare my sentiments
  faithfully in these my last discourses. The next minute led
  me to the reflection,&mdash;Have I any right to stand in that
  pulpit, being once convinced that the Church is heretical to
  which it belongs? Am I safe in exposing myself to the
  danger which may attend one day's travelling, while I turn
  my back on the Church of God, which now calls me to unite
  myself to her for ever? I said to Phillipps: 'If this step is
  right for me to take next week, it is my duty to take it now.
  My resolution is made; to-morrow I will be received into
  the Church.' We lost no time in despatching a messenger to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
  my father, to inform him of this unexpected event. As I
  was forming my last resolution, the thought of him came
  across me; will it not be said that I endanger his very life
  by so sudden and severe a shock? The words of our Lord
  rose before me, and answered all my doubts: 'He that
  hateth not father and mother, and brothers and sisters, and
  houses and lands, and his own life too, cannot be my disciple.'
  To the Lord, then, I trusted for the support and
  comfort of my dear father under the trial which, in obedience
  to His call, I was about to inflict upon him. I had no
  further anxiety to disturb me. God alone knows the peace
  and joy with which I laid me down that night to rest. The
  next day, at nine o'clock, the Church received me for her
  child."

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br>
His First Days In The Church.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Conversions to Catholicism were not such
every-day occurrences, some thirty years ago,
as they are now. The disabilities under which
Catholics laboured politically, before 1829, made
them hide their heads, except when forced into
public notice by efforts to break their shackles. The religion
that civilized England, and consecrated every remarkable
spot in it to the service of God, had become a thing of the
past, and the relics of Catholic piety that studded the land
were looked upon as the gravestones of its corse, or the
trophies of vanquishing Protestantism. Not only was
Catholicity supposed to be dead in England, but its memory
was in execration; nurses frightened the children with
phantoms of monks, and mountebank preachers took their
inspiration from the prejudices they had imbibed in childhood.
The agitation about the <i>Veto</i>, and the Debates on the
Catholic question, which filled the public mind about the
year 1830, and for some ten years before, showed that
Catholicity had not died, but only slept. The Catholics
emerged from their dens and caverns; they bought and sold,
spoke and listened, like their neighbours; and the King was
not afraid of a Catholic ball when he took his next airing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
in Hyde Park. The Catholic Church had been barely given
leave to eke out its declining days, with something like the
indulgence allowed a condemned criminal, when, to the
astonishment of all, it sprung up with new vigour, and
waxed and throve in numbers and in position. It was considered
worth a hearing now, and faith came by hearing to
many, who would have been horrified before at opening by
chance such an antichristian thing as a Catholic book. A
conversion, then, rather stunned than embittered the relatives
of the convert. The full tide of Tractarianism had
not yet set in, and the systematic pitchforks of private
persecution and stately rebuke, that were afterwards invented
to stop it, were not so much as thought of. The conversion
of the Honourable George Spencer happened in those peculiar
times. His family were partially prepared for it, for
fluctuating between so many religious opinions as he had
been for so long, and earnest, too, in pushing arguments to
their furthest length, it was often half suspected that he
would go to Popery at last. There he was now, a child of
the Catholic Church, shrived and baptized according to her
ritual. His die was cast. He was fixed for ever. His
wandering was at an end. With the exception of his house-keeper,
who laid her down to die for sheer affliction at the
news, we are not aware that many others were much moved
by what they considered his defection. Doubtless, his father
and the immediate family circle felt it deeply; his Protestant
vagaries had caused them sleepless nights and silent afternoons,
and the Church of which he became a member was
not likely to seem less absurd to them than it once seemed
to himself. But then he was incorrigible; there was no
use talking to him; he would have his own way, and there
was what it led to.
</p>
<p>
Lord Spencer was always favourable to Catholics, but it
was in the spirit of generosity to a fallen, or justice to an
injured people. He never dreamt his own son would be one
of the first to reap the benefit of the measures he advocated
in Parliament. The letter he received from Leicester in
January, 1830, must have been a shock indeed. Besides, a
member of this aristocratic house descending to such a level
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
must be considered a family disgrace&mdash;an event to be wept
over as long as there was one to glory in the name of
Spencer, or feel for its <i>prestige</i>. Taking all these things
into account, and many other minor considerations, it would
be no wonder if Mr. Spencer was treated with harshness,
and banished Althorp for ever. Nothing of the kind. His
father was very considerate; and liberal, too, in making
a provision for his son's future maintenance. George himself
was received on friendly terms by every branch of the
family, and, so far from avoiding him or mortifying him,
they seemed all to have respected his sincerity. He wrote
to Dr. Walsh, the Vicar Apostolic of the central district,
immediately after his reception into the Church, placing
himself as a subject at his lordship's disposition. Mr.
Spencer's idea was to be ordained as soon as possible, and
come back to his own parish to preach, like St. Paul, against
his former teaching. This intention was checked by the
Bishop's writing word for him to put off his first Communion
a little longer, and to come and meet his Lordship in
Wolverhampton towards the middle of February. This
letter he received in F. Caestryck's, in Leicester, three days
after his reception. He thinks the arrangement excellent.
He spent a fortnight in the priest's house at Leicester, and
he used often to say that this good priest's way of settling
difficulties, though it might look unsatisfactory, was the very
best thing that ever occurred to him. He made Mr. Spencer
fully aware of the great dogma of the Church's infallibility
before he received him. F. Caestryck was one of those good
emigre priests who were well up in the Church's positive and
moral theology, but cared very little for polemics. Whenever
Mr. Spencer asked him "Why was anything such a
way in Catholic teaching?" the old man simply replied:
"The Church says so." This was very wise at such a time;
the period for reasoning and discussion was passed, and the
neophyte had to be taught to exercise the faith he had
adopted now. He learnt the lesson very well, and was
saved from the danger of arguing himself out of the Church
again, as some do who do not leave their private judgment
outside the Church-door, at their conversion.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
<p>
Scarcely anything is so remarkable as the readiness with
which, on his reception, he laid down all notions of his
being a minister of God. One short extract from a letter to
his housekeeper, enclosing money from Leicester, to pay bills,
will illustrate this: "If you have an opportunity, tell those
who choose to attend, that I have acknowledged the authority
of the Catholic Church, and therefore resigned my
ministry for the present. If they care for my advice, tell
them to send for Mr. Foley (the priest at Northampton), and
hear him as the minister of God." This letter was written
before he was a week a Catholic, and it promises well for
his future that he does not arrogate to himself the office of
teacher before he is commissioned, much less before he is
sufficiently instructed. Many, in their first fervour, make
false steps in the way he avoided which it is often difficult to
retrace. The glow of happiness at finding one's self in <i>the
Church</i> ought to be allowed to subside, and to allow the newborn
judgment to be capable of discretion, before beginning
to dabble in theology.
</p>
<p>
He pays a visit to Brington in a few days, in company
with F. Caestryck, and writes beforehand to his housekeeper
to collect a few of his faithful listeners, that he may get
them a few words of advice from a real live priest. It seems,
from hints thrown out here and there in his letters, that
Bishop Walsh was for his going to Rome to prepare himself
for Orders. This was a drawback to his own plan, but
events will show how wisely the Bishop arranged. Mr.
Spencer's anxiety to be ordained at once and sent out to
preach is an evidence of the strength of his faith. He
imagined the Sacrament of Orders would have infused all
ecclesiastical knowledge into his soul, and it was only when
he had to work hard at the study of theology that he perceived
the wisdom of blind submission to the judgment of
his superiors. He goes to London to consult Dr. Bramston
as to what he had better do, and he gives the result in
a letter to Mr. Phillipps.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "London, <i>Feb</i>. 18, 1830.
<br><br>
  "My Dear Ambrose,&mdash;I write from Bishop Bramston's
  study; he has left me there, and is gone to transact a little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
  business in another room. I have passed through my interview
  with my father, and thank God for it. His kindness
  was very great, joined with great depth of feeling. I
  will tell you more of it soon, when we meet. I shall leave
  London on Saturday for Northampton, where I am to be at
  Lady Throckmorton's till Monday. I shall then proceed to
  Birmingham by a coach which passes through Northampton
  from Cambridge, at one or two o'clock. On the next day, Tuesday,
  I will go to Wolverhampton, where I hope to meet you,
  my dear brother. I shall have plenty more to tell you
  then. Now, let it suffice to say that all my family and
  Bishop Bramston are decidedly for the Roman plan. I
  suppose the Lord so intends it. His will be done and His
  glory advanced; I will be as wax in His hand. My father
  has made me quite comfortable for money, and in the most
  prudent way. Farewell, my brother, and believe me,<br>
    "Your affectionate<br>
      "George Spencer."
</p>
<p>
He expressed his gratitude, again and again, for the
manner in which his family received him, especially as he
knew that his late step was looked upon by them as "an
unmixed evil." They were even willing to receive him as
a guest wherever they might be staying except at Althorp;
and, at Dr. Bramston's suggestion, he agreed to these terms,
as well as made up his mind not to go to Brington again, in
compliance with his father's wishes. These matters he
arranged in a few days; he pensioned off one or two of his
servants, he made his will about his stock of sermons, and
it was, "Give them to the new incumbent, and let him do
what he likes with them."
</p>
<p>
He had some difficulty in obeying his Bishop with regard
to "the Roman plan," as he calls it. It was the first test
of his obedience. He thought it was because the Bishop
was weak enough to yield to the wishes of his family that
he was sent. These wishes appeared to him to proceed from
principles to which the Church's policy should not suit
itself. There would be a noise made in the papers about
his conversion, and his friends would have to answer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
questions about him in inquisitive circles. His father did not
wish him to go to Brington, and he himself was most
anxious to use the influence he possessed over his dependants
in order to their conversion. To avoid these inconveniences
and clashing of motives they desired he might be
absent from England for some time. Some of his friends
also thought going to Rome would make him Protestant
again; for, he says in a letter written a few days after his
arrival in Rome, "You see now that coming to Rome does
not open my eyes and make me wish myself a Protestant
again. You may tell all Protestants that I am under no
charm, and if anything occurs to make me see that ours is
an apostate Church, I shall not, I trust, perversely suffer my
fate to be bound up with hers, and consent to die in her
plagues." The public parade of Catholic ceremonial had
not formerly produced the best of effects upon him, and
perhaps it was expected the old feelings would be revived
by seeing the same things once more.

The very reasons his friends had for detaining him might
urge the Bishop to hasten his departure. His anxiety to
go and preach Catholicity in Brington was not quite according
to prudence, for though he might know the principal
dogmas of faith and believe them firmly, he still needed that
Catholic instinct and mode of thought which can nowhere
be imbibed so quickly or so surely as in Rome. There are
many traits of Protestant <i>viewiness</i> to be seen in his letters
at this period, but,
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Quo semel imbuta est recens servabit odorem,
   Testa din."
</p>
<p>
It would not have been so easy to bring these properly
into subjection whilst he had the thousand-and-one forms of
Protestant errors seething around him, and would be forced
by his zeal to seek out ways of making Catholic truth approach
them. Where everything was Catholic to the very
core, in might and majesty, was the best school for tutoring
him into Catholic feelings and ideas. It was well also
to let him see the force of prejudice, by making him
experience in himself how differently things seem according
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
to the state of one's mind. If he was shocked at Rome as
a Protestant, it was well to let him know that it was because
he was unable to understand as a Protestant what gave him
so much joy and edification, when he could see with Catholic
eyes.

A courier was leaving London for Ancona, and as he did
not see any reason for delay, he took a seat with him, and
started for Rome on the 1st March, and arrived on the
12th, the feast of St. Gregory. He contrived to make the
acquaintance of Mr. Digby in Paris, and hear mass three
times during his journey, which was considered a very
quickly made one in those days. He also had a very
pleasing interview with Cardinal Mezzofanti in passing
through Bologna.

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br>
Mr. Spencer In The English College, Rome.</h2>
<br>
<p>
On the evening of his arrival in Rome he went to the
English College and presented himself to Dr. Wiseman, the
late Cardinal, who was the rector. Dr. Wiseman had heard
of his conversion, but did not expect to see him so soon,
and while they were conversing and giving and receiving
explanations, two letters arrived by post from Bishops
Bramston and Walsh, which put everything in its proper
place. Here then we have this distinguished convert lodged
in a student's cell to prepare for receiving real Orders in
due time. He gives his impressions of the college in a letter
to Mr. Phillipps, written about a week after his arrival, as
follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have felt most completely comfortable and
  happy ever since I have been here. The life of the college
  is of course regular and strict. I could not have believed in
  the existence of a society for education such as this, half a
  year ago. Such discipline and obedience, united with
  perfect freedom and cordiality, is the fruit of the Catholic
  religion alone, in which we learn really to look on men as
  bearing rule in God's name, so that they need not keep up
  their influence by affectation of superiority and mysterious
  reserve. I do not know all the members of the college by
  name even yet, but, as far as I do, I can speak only in one
  language of them all. I have kept company principally
  with the rector and vice-rector, as I am not put on the
  footing of the ordinary students, being a <i>convictor</i>, that is,
  paying my own way, and also brought here under such
  peculiarity of circumstances as warrants some distinction,
  though I desire to make that as little as possible. I do not
  go with the others to the public schools, but am to study at
  home under Dr. Wiseman and Dr. Errington. The rules
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
  of the house I observe, and indeed so do the rectors as the
  rest."
</p>
<p>
The peace of sober college life could not long remain
unalloyed, if it were to be lasting. Whilst Mr. Spencer was
studying his Moral or Dogma by the little lamp, and unmoved
except by the anxiety to read faster, in order to be
sooner in the field to work for God, the world outside was
not disposed to forget him. Various rumours were set
afloat about Northampton concerning him; one would account
for his sudden disappearance, another for his resignation
of his living, a third would set about unravelling the
popish plots of which he must have been a dupe. These
were trifling pastimes, which could be ungrudgingly permitted
for the better savouring of devout tea-parties: but
surmise will not be content with all this. There was his
housekeeper, who became ill immediately, and was near
dying. What did that mean? Slanderous reports were set
on foot, and the answer to them is the most complete refutation
that could possibly be given, while it is at the same
time a proof of his virtue. On May 17th, 1830, he thus
writes from the English college to the housekeeper, who
had mentioned the matter in a letter to him:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  .... "I see that it has pleased God that you should
  suffer under calumny; thank God, most undeserved. It is
  evident that this slander affects my character as much as
  yours, and there is hardly a state of life to be conceived
  where such imputations are more injurious than a priest's;
  yet if all men should believe it, and I should live and die
  under this evil report, God forbid I should willingly repine.
  It would be no trial to suffer calumny, if it was not at first
  a painful thing; and therefore I do not wonder, nor find
  fault with you, at your being greatly afflicted when you
  were so insulted and abused as you describe; but, my dear
  girl, you should not have <i>allowed</i> this to weigh upon your
  mind. You have more reason to grieve for this proof of
  how weak your faith and love to God is, than for the slander.
  I think it was a mistake that you did not tell me of this at
  Northampton. I trust I should then and shall always
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
  rejoice, when I am counted worthy to suffer reproach for the
  sake of Christ; and I thank God that such is this reproach.
  I deserve reproach enough, it is true; and both you and I,
  if we look through our past lives, shall see that we deserve
  this and much more for our sins. Let us then learn to
  accept the bitter words of unfeeling men, as David did the
  curses of Semei, as ordered by God for our chastening, that
  we may be purified by them, and He will then turn their
  calumnies into greater honour one day or other. Though
  you had better have told me, as I might have helped you at
  once to overcome your annoyance, yet it may have been
  better for you to suffer it thus long, that you may learn how
  much you do care for character, and may henceforth give
  that up as well as everything besides that you love on earth.
  If you are so afflicted at a false reproach against you, what
  would your feelings have been if the Lord had seen fit to
  prove you, by suffering you indeed to fall; and where is
  your strength or mine, that we should be innocent in anything
  for a day, except through His grace? Just think over
  the matter with yourself, and let this word of advice be
  sufficient, and let me have the happiness of knowing that
  you are again what I remember you, patient, and meek, and
  cheerful, and allowing nothing to concern you but to please
  God more and more, and work out your salvation. I see
  by your letter, which I look at again, that you certainly
  would have told me of this at Northampton, had you judged
  for yourself, and perhaps it was right that you should act in
  it as you were advised. Therefore, do not take what I say
  now as if I had anything but the sincerest love and respect
  for you; I only speak to warn you of your spiritual wants,
  in which I partake with you. A woman's feelings are more
  tender, of course, under such cruel insults. When my feelings
  are hurt I find the same proof that I do not love God
  as I ought to do, and surely we never can have too much of
  that love. How infinitely blessed are you that you are
  singled out from the herd of those who prosper in the world,
  and have all men speaking well of them, and are permitted
  to walk in the way by which alone we can attain to the
  kingdom set before us. Remember the most blessed and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
  glorious Virgin, Mary, of all creatures the most beloved and
  most worthy to be loved of God, who was saluted by an
  angel as full of grace, and is now in heaven, Queen of
  Angels, and Prophets, and Apostles, and Martyrs. How
  was her infinite honour of being mother of God made the
  occasion of most cruel suspicions against her heavenly purity.
  If she was content to bear this with perfect meekness and
  humility for God's sake, surely you may say with her, 'be
  it done unto me according to thy word,' whether He shall
  order you to bear this or any other trouble. If occasion is
  put before you to prove yourself undeserving of such imputations,
  do not neglect to use it, for God's honour, which
  suffers by our being supposed guilty, and for the good of
  your slanderers, who may be brought to repentance by a due
  reproof; but take no pains about it, except in prayer to God,
  and in examining throughout all your past ways, what may
  be the cause of the affliction as ordered by Him. I am sure
  I can hardly find anything to accuse you of. I used to
  delight in your conversation, and you did in mine; but,
  thank God, great as my sins have been, I never, I believe,
  said a word to wound your delicacy, and you never transgressed
  the bounds of respect which a servant ought to show
  towards a master. But those who, for their own sorrow,
  will not learn what the joys of spiritual friendship are, cannot
  understand any intimacy but that which is sensual and
  gross. As, therefore, I left home so suddenly, and they
  could not again understand the possibility that my faith
  should be so suddenly established, and that, for the sake of
  it, I was willing to give up my home, and as you showed
  such emotion at learning that I was to leave you, these
  people had no way to account for the whole matter but
  imputing to us shameful guilt."
</p>
<p>
From Mr. Spencer's charity before he became a Catholic
we may conclude what it must have been now. It would
seem that, in temporals, he had not those difficulties in the
way of his conversion that beset many Protestant clergymen
who depend solely on their livings. But, the sacrifices
he willingly made, prove that the prospect of sheer want
even would not have deterred him from following God's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
call. A few days after his conversion he went to see the
Dominican Fathers at Hinckley, and said, in conversation,
"I suppose it is not lawful for me to receive the fruits of my
benefice, now that I have ceased to be a minister of the
Establishment." One of them said, "Certainly not." Whereupon
he asked for a sheet of paper, wrote a letter to the
Protestant bishop in a few minutes, resigning his cure, and
simply said, as he impressed the seal, "There goes 3,000 a
year." He was then wholly dependent on his father's
bounty, and if unworthy motives had had any force with
Earl Spencer, his son might have found himself penniless.
From the allowance granted him he received monthly whilst
in Rome much more than was sufficient to pay his way in
the college. It was remarked, however, that the day after
he got his money he had not a farthing in his possession,
and on inquiry it was found that what remained from the
college pension he distributed regularly among the poor.
Dr. Wiseman turned the channel of his charity to a more
profitable object, knowing how much he would be imposed
on by the Roman beggars, and several monuments still look
fresh in the chapel of the English College, which were repaired
by what remained over and above what was absolutely
necessary of his income. It seems as if he never could bear
to be the possessor of money; he would scruple having it
about him. He was known, even when a minister, to draw
money out of the bank in Northampton, and give the last
sixpence of it to the poor before he got to Brington.
</p>
<p>
Before August, 1830, he received minor orders, and
immediately after hears the news that Mary Wykes, his
housekeeper, has become a Catholic. It is a singular fact
that she took his conversion so to heart that she nearly died,
and was yet the first to follow his example. She was delicate
in health, of a respectable family in his parish, and Mr.
Spencer acknowledges that he is under many obligations to
her father. He settles an annuity of 25 or 30 a year
upon her for life, and writes to her from the English College
thus: "Pray to God to give you a tender devotion to her
whom He loves above all creatures, and who of all creatures
is the most pure, amiable, and exalted. I dare say you will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
have found difficulty, as I have done, in overcoming the
prejudices in which we have been brought up against devotion
to the Saints of God; but let this very thing make you the
more diligent in asking of God to give you that devotion
to them which He delights in seeing us cultivate."
</p>
<p>
On the 13th of March, <i>Sabbato Sitientis</i>, 1831, he received
the Subdiaconate, This is the great step, as Catholics know,
in the life of one destined for the priesthood. The Subdiaconate
imposes perpetual celibacy, with the obligation of
daily reciting the divine office, and it is then the young
cleric is first styled Reverend. It is said that a few days
after his receiving this sacred order, a message was sent him
by his family not to become a priest, as it was feared his
brother would have no issue, and George was looked to as
the only source whence an heir presumptive could arise for
the earldom. He simply answered, "You spoke too late,"
an answer he would have given whether or no, as he had
long ago determined never to marry. It was at this time
also he wrote, at the request of the Bishop of Oppido, the
<i>Account of my Conversion</i>,&mdash;a work well known to English
readers.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br>
F. Spencer Is Ordained Priest.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Father Spencer, ever since he first turned completely to
the service of God, was determined to do whatever he knew
to be more perfect. He did not understand serving God by
halves; he thought He deserved to be loved with "all our
strength, all our mind, and above all things." This he knew
to be a precept, a strict command given by our divine Lord.
How it was to be observed was his difficulty. He was
groping in the dark hitherto, and though not making many
false steps, still far from clearly seeing his way to perfection.
The exactness of Catholic theology, which sifts every question
to the last atom, made him meet this one face to face.
</p>
<p>
The first difficulty he had to master was the received
axiom that <i>the religious state is more perfect than the secular</i>.
He could not see how a vow, which apparently takes away a
man's liberty, could increase the merit of actions done under
it. As the vow of obedience is the principal one in religion,
so much so that in some orders subjects are professed
by promising obedience according to the rule, its explanation
would remove the difficulty. Two things principally
constitute the superiority of <i>vowed actions</i>. One, that they
must be of a better good; the second, that the will is
confirmed in the doing of them. A vow must be of a good
better than another good&mdash;such as celibacy better than
marriage, poverty better than riches, obedience to proper
authority better than absolute liberty. The state of religion
which takes these three walks of life as essential to its
constitution is insomuch better than any other state. But the
question comes, why not observe poverty, chastity, and
obedience, without vowing them? "Would it not be better that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
the practice of these virtues should be spontaneous, than
that a person should put himself under the moral necessity
of not deviating from it? No; because it is a weak will
which reserves to itself the right of refusing to persevere in
a sacrifice. If a man intends to observe chastity, but reserves
to himself the right to marry whenever he pleases,
he signifies by his state of mind that he may some day
repent of his choice, and makes provision for that defalcation.
That is a want of generosity, it is a safety valve by
which trusting to God's grace escapes, and perfection can
never be attained while one has the least notion of the
possibility of doing less for God than he does. "He that
puts his hand to the plough and turns back is not worthy."
By a vow, a person not only resolves to do for the present
what is perfect, but to continue doing it for life, and as the
person knows right well that his natural strength will not
carry him through, he trusts the issue to God's goodness.
This fixing of the will, and narrowing, as far as possible,
the range of our liberty, is an assimilation of the present
state to the state of the blessed. They do the will of God
and cannot help doing it, they have no liberty of sinning,
and the vow of obedience by which a man binds himself to
do God's will, manifested to him through his superiors or
his rule, takes away from him the least rational inclination
for liberty to sin. Not only that, but he makes it a sin to
recede from God one step, and he sacrifices to his Creator a
portion of the liberty that is granted to us all. It is a sin
for a man who has a vow of chastity to marry, though
naturally he was perfectly free to do so. He sacrificed that
freedom to God, and lest he might be inclined to backslide
at any future day he put the barrier of this moral obligation
behind him. The person under vow is God's peculiar
property; all his actions are in a certain sense sacred, and
of double merit in His sight. Be it remembered that
a religious makes this sacrifice freely, and it is in this free
dedication to God's service perpetually of body, soul, and
possessions, without reserving the right to claim back anything
for self, that the special excellence of the religious
state consists.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
<p>
There are several other less cogent arguments in favour
of the religious state, as that without it we should not
have the Evangelical virtues practised which form the principal
part of the note of holiness in the Church. That it is
easier to practice great virtue in a monastery than in the
world, and that more religious have been canonized than
seculars since the time of the martyrs.
</p>
<p>
Father Spencer came to understand that the religious
state is more perfect than the secular, though he knew
that many seculars are far more perfect than some religious,
but one point he could never get over, and that was since
vows undoubtedly do raise the merit of one's actions, why
cannot people take and observe vows without shutting
themselves up within the walls of a convent? He consulted
many grave theologians, doctors, and even cardinals, for the
solution of this problem. He was told, to be sure, that it
was quite possible in the abstract to have a people observing
vows, but that in practice it proved to be chimerical and
Utopian. <i>What is possible can be done</i>, was his maxim, and
he resolved to begin with himself. He was told by Dr.
Wiseman and Cardinal Weld that he seemed to have a
religious vocation. He wrote accordingly to his diocesan,
Dr. Walsh, who dissuaded him from becoming a religious by
saying that, though it was a better state, a secular priest
could be more useful in England. Others differed from this
opinion, but F. Spencer heard in it the voice of his
Superior, and resolved to obey it for the present. This
settled matters for the time, but his <i>view</i> could never be got
out of his head. He gets thoroughly engrossed now with
his approaching ordination. It grieves him to see souls lost
in heresy and sin in a way that few grieve; for, the concern
he felt for the spiritual destitution of his country began to
tell upon his health. It is feared he will die; he begins to
spit blood, and several consumptive symptoms alarm his
physicians. He is removed to Fiumicino, and writes a long
letter from his sick bed there to Mr. Phillipps. In this letter
he hopes his friend may be caught into the Church like his
patron, St. Ambrose. Here we have the first evidence of
his getting thoroughly into a Catholic way of thinking.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Nothing strikes a cold, careful, Catholic, who has been
brought up in a Protestant atmosphere, so much as the
wonderful familiarity of Spanish and Italian boys with the
lives of the Saints. They quote a Saint for everything, and
they can tell you directly how St. Peter of Alcantara would
season his dinner, or how St. Rose of Lima would make
use of ornaments. Father Spencer has paragraphs in every
letter at this time full of hints taken from Saints' lives,
showing that he evidently gave a great portion of his time
to learn ascetic theology in these remarkable volumes. He
is wishing also that Mr. Digby should become a priest, but
in both cases he was doomed to be disappointed so far, though
both his friends graced, by their virtues, the state of
life in which they remained. He was ordained Deacon on
the 17th December, Quater tense, 1831; and on the 26th of
May, 1832, two years and four months after his reception
into the Church, he was ordained Priest by Cardinal Zurla.
He thus writes to Mr. Phillipps on the event: "I made my
arrangements directly (on being called off suddenly to England)
for ordination to the priesthood on St. Philip Neri's
Day, and saying my first mass on the day following, which
was Sunday. How will you sympathise with my joy when,
in the middle of my retreat, Dr. Wiseman told me, what
none of us had observed at first, that the 26th May was not
only St. Philip's feast at Rome, but in England that of St.
Augustine, our Apostle, and that he should ask Cardinal
Zurla to ordain me in St. Gregory's Church, which his
Eminence did. It was at St. Gregory's only that we learned
from the monks that the next day was the deposition of
Venerable Bede."
</p>
<p>
The coincidences are really remarkable with regard to his
destination for the English mission. He was born on the
feast of the Apostle St. Thomas; he arrived in Rome, as a
Catholic, on the feast of St. Gregory; he was ordained on the
feast of St. Augustine of Canterbury; he said his first mass
of St. Bede, by special leave from the Pope, on that Saint's
day. He was ordained by a Cardinal of the Camaldolese
branch of the Benedictine Order, to which St. Augustine
belonged; and he got the blessing and commission of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
Pope Gregory XVI., a member of the same order; and
under all these auspices set out directly for England.
</p>
<p>
During his stay in Rome he made the acquaintance of our
Father Dominic. This was a great happiness to him. Father
Dominic was on fire for the conversion of England, and
Father Spencer echoed back, with additions, every sentiment
of his zealous soul. They spoke together, they wrote to
each other, they got devout people to pray, and prayed
themselves every day, for the conversion of England. We
cannot know how far prayers go, we only know that the
continual prayer of the just man availeth much; and therefore,
it might not seem safe reasoning, to attribute effects that
can be traced to other causes to the prayers of some devout
servants of God. Without attempting to assign causes, we
cannot help remarking the fact that these two holy souls
began to pray, and enlist others in praying, for England's
conversion in 1832, and that the first number of the "Tracts
for the Times" appeared before the end of 1833. Neither
of them had anything to do with the Tracts, if we except a
few letters from Father Dominic in a Belgian newspaper, as
writers or suggestors of matter; but both took a deep
interest in them, and fed their hopes, as each appeared more
Catholic than the one before. He spends a week with
Father Dominic in Lucca, on his way to England, and in
Geneva happened one of those interesting events with which
his life was chequered. He thus tells it in a letter to the
<i>Catholic Standard</i> in 1853:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I went one day, at Genoa
  (see Chap. IX., Bk. i.), in 1820, to see the great relics in the
  treasury of the Cathedral. Relics, indeed, were little to
  me; but to get at these, three keys from various first-rate
  dignitaries, ecclesiastical and civil, were necessary. This
  was enough to make a young English sight-seer determined
  to get at them. A young priest, the sacristan of the Cathedral,
  received me and the party I had made up to accompany
  me, and showed us the precious treasures. I did nothing
  but despise; and yet why should I, or other Protestants,
  look on it as a kind of impossibility that any relic can be
  genuine? However, so I did; and I let the sacristan
  plainly know it. Yet he was not vexed. Nay, he treated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
  me with great affection, and said, among other things, 'The
  English are a worthy, good people, <i>brava nazione</i>; if only
  it had not been for that moment, that unhappy moment!'
  'What moment do you mean?' said I. 'Ah! surely,' he
  replied, 'when Henry VIII. resolved on revolting against
  the Church.' I did not answer, but I thought within
  myself, 'Poor man, what ignorance! what infatuation!
  And what were my thoughts of that moment of which he
  spoke? My thoughts on this head had been formed in my
  young days, and, oh! how deep are first young thoughts
  allowed to take firm root undisturbed! When I was a
  child"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Here he relates the discourse of his sisters'
governess about the English Reformation, given in a former
chapter. "When, accordingly, the Genoese priest thus spoke
I thought, Poor, blind man! little he knows what England
gained at that same moment for which he pities it. ...
I cannot but add to this last circumstance, that twelve years
later I was returning from Rome&mdash;a priest! I came by sea.
Stopping one day in the harbour of Genoa, I went on shore
to say mass at the Cathedral, and found the same priest still
at the head of the sacristy&mdash;the same benign features I saw,
but somewhat marked with age. I asked him did he remember
and recognise the young English disputer?
<i>O altitudo</i>! .... And is it I whom they would expect
to give up my poor countrymen for hopeless? No! leave
this to others, who have not tasted like me the fruits of the
tender mercies of God."
</p>
<p>
As soon as he arrived in England, he went to see his
family, who were in Ryde for the summer, according to
their custom. He was cordially welcomed; but it must
seem a cold thing for a newly-ordained priest to come to a
home where not a brother or sister would kneel to get his
blessing, nor father nor mother be in ecstacy of joy at hearing
him say mass for the first time. This was in July, 1832.
Early in August he met several priests at Sir Edward
Doughty's, Upton House, Dorsetshire; and Lady Doughty
says:&mdash;"Mr. Spencer greatly edified all who then met him
by his humility, fervour, and earnest desire for the
conversion of England. On the 11th of August he left Upton,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
accompanied by Dr. Logan, for Prior Park. On that morning,
as the coach from Poole passed at an early hour, Mr.
Spencer engaged one of the men servants to serve his mass
at five o'clock. The servant went to call him soon after four,
but finding the room apparently undisturbed, he proceeded to
the little domestic chapel, and there he found Mr. Spencer
prostrate before the altar in fervent prayer, and he then rose
and said mass; the servant's conviction being, that he had
been there in prayer all night."
</p>
<p>
An incident occurred, as Father Spencer was passing
through Bordeaux on his way to England, which deserves
especial mention, if only to recall the droll pleasure he used
to experience himself, and create in others, while relating it.
He met there a great, big, fat convert, who had just made
his abjuration and been baptised. Father Spencer questioned
him about his first communion, and the trouble of
preparing himself "in his then state of body" seemed an
awful exertion. However, after a great deal of what the
gentleman termed "painful goading," Father Spencer succeeded
in bringing him to the altar. The fat gentleman sat
him down afterwards to melt in the shade of a midsummer
June day in Bordeaux, grumbling yet delighted at the exertion
he had made. The Bishop of Bordeaux was giving
confirmation in some of the churches in the town, and
Father Spencer thought he should not lose the opportunity
of getting his fat friend to the sacrament. He knew how
hateful exertion of any kind was to the neophyte, who,
though he believed all the Catholic doctrines in a kind of a
heap, was not over-inclined for works of supererogation.
He resolved to do what he could. He went to him, and
boldly told him that he ought to prepare himself for
confirmation. "What!" exclaimed the gentleman, making an
effort to yawn, "have I not done yet? Is there more to be
got through before I am a perfect Catholic? Oh, dear!"
And he moved himself. He was brought through, however,
to the no small inconvenience of himself and others, and
many was the moral Father Ignatius pointed afterwards
with this first essay of his in missionary work.
</p>
<p>
At Prior Park, Father Spencer met Dr. Walsh, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
was appointed to begin a new mission in West Bromwich;
he sets about it immediately, and gets an altar for it from
Lord Dormer in Walsall. He met Dr. Wiseman, who came
to England about this time, and they are both invited by
Earl Spencer to spend a day at Althorp. The Earl was
charmed with Dr. Wiseman, and Father Spencer exclaims,
in a letter, "What a grand point was this! A Catholic
priest, and a D.D., rector of a Catholic college, received
with distinction at a Protestant nobleman's!" He met
some of his old parishioners, and was welcomed by them
with love and kind remembrances. His church in West
Bromwich was opened on the 21st November, 1832, and
he was settled down as a Catholic pastor near where he
hunted as a Protestant layman, and preached heresy as a
Protestant minister.

<br>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br>
F. Spencer Begins His Missionary Life.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Far different is the position on which Mr. Spencer enters
towards the close of 1832, from that which he was promoted
to in 1825. Then he took the cure of souls with vague notions
of his precise duty; now he took the cure of souls as
a clearly defined duty, for the fulfilment of which he knew
he should render a severe account. Then he received a
large income from the bare fact of his being put in possession
of his post; now he has to expend even what he has
in trying to provide a place of worship for his flock. Then,
there were eight hundred souls under his charge, most of
them wealthy and comfortable, and all looking up to him
with respect for being his father's son; now he could scarcely
count half that number as his own, scattered among hovels
and garrets; amid their more opulent neighbours, who mocked
him for being a priest. He then dwelt with pleasure on his
rich benefice, and on the rising walls of his handsome
rectory; now he prayed the bishop to put him into the
poorest mission in the diocese, and delighted in being housed
like the poor. The life he led as a priest in West Bromwich
is worthy of the ancient solitaries. He began by
placing all his property in the bishop's hands, and his lordship
appointed an <i>Econome</i>, who gave him now and again
such sums as he needed to keep himself alive, give something
to the poor, and supply his church with necessaries.
He keeps an account of every farthing he spends, and shows
it to the Bishop at the end of the quarter, to see if his
lordship approves, or wishes anything to be retrenched for the
future. His ordinary course of life was&mdash;rise at six,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
Meditation Office and Mass, hear some confessions, and, after
breakfast, at ten, go out through the parish until six, when he
came home to dinner, and spent the time that was left till
supper in instructing catechumens, reading, praying, or
writing. He had no luxuries, no comforts, he scarcely
allowed himself any recreation, except in doing pastoral
work. He leaves two rooms of his little house unfurnished,
and says he has something else to do with the money that
might be thus spent. Much as he loved Mr. Phillipps, he
did not go to see him after his marriage, because he thought
it was not necessary to spend money in that way which could
alleviate the poverty of a parishioner; and because he did
not like to be a day absent from his parish work as long as
God gave him strength. During the first year of his residence
at West Bromwich he opens three schools; one of
them had been a pork-shop, and was bought for him by a
Catholic tradesman. Here he used to come and lecture once
or twice a week, and is surprised and pleased to find a
well-ordered assembly ready to listen to him. He says in a letter
at this time: "I go to bed weary every night, and enjoy my
sleep more than great people do theirs; for it is the sleep of
the labourer." He is rather sanguine in his hopes of
converting Protestants; but, although he receives a good many
into the Church, he finds error more difficult to root out
than he imagined. He bears up, however, and a letter to
Mr. Phillipps will tell us what he thought; he says: "Keep
England's conversion always next your heart. It is no small
matter to overturn a dynasty so settled and rooted as that of
error in this country; and how are we possibly to expect
that we shall be made instruments to effect this, unless we
become in some measure conformable to the characters of the
Saints who have done such things before us? Yet let us not
give up the undertaking, for as, on the one hand, no one has
succeeded without wonderful labour and patience, so, on the
other, none ever has failed when duly followed up. Let
us not be discouraged by opposition, but work the more
earnestly: and as we see people about some hard bodily
exertion begin with their clothes on, but, when they find
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
the difficulty of their job, strip first the coat, then the
waistcoat, then turn up their sleeves, and so on, we must do
the same. God does not give success at once, because He
wishes us better than to remain as we are, fettered and
attached to the world. If we succeeded before all this encumbrance
is stripped off, we should certainly not get rid of it
afterwards." He did "turn up his sleeves," and toil, no
doubt, at converting his neighbours; he opened a new mission
in Dudley towards the Christmas of 1833; he first
began in an old warehouse, which he fitted up with a chapel
and seats, and turned one or two little houses adjoining into
a sacristy and sitting-room for the priest who might come
there to officiate.
</p>
<p>
He goes on in this even course for the whole of the two
first years of his life in West Bromwich, without any striking
event to bring one part more prominently forward than
another. His every day work was not, however, all plain
sailing; in proportion as his holiness of life increased the
reverence Catholics began to conceive for him, it provoked
the persecution and contempt of the Protestants. He was
pensive generally, and yet had a keen relish for wit and
humour. He was one day speaking with a brother priest in
his sacristy, with sad earnestness, about the spiritual
destitution of the poor people around him, who neither knew
God, nor would listen to those who were willing to teach
them. A poor woman knocked at the sacristy door, and was
ordered to come in; she fell on her knees very reverently,
to get Father Spencer's blessing, as soon as she approached
him. His companion observed that this poor woman reminded
him of the mother of the sons of Zebedee, who came
to Our Saviour <i>adorans</i>. "Yes," replied Father Spencer, with
a very arch smile, "and not only <i>adorans</i>, but <i>petens aliquid
ah eo</i>" Such was his usual way; he would season his discourse
on the most important subject&mdash;even go a little out
of his way for that purpose&mdash;with a pointed anecdote, or
witty remark.
</p>
<p>
All did not feel inclined to follow the old woman's example
in the first part of the above scene, though many were led
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
to do so through their love and practice of the second. A
person sent us the following letter, who still lives on the spot
that was blessed by this holy priest's labours, and as it bears
evidence to some of the statements we have made from other
sources, it may be well to give it insertion:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I was one of his first converts at West Bromwich, and
  a fearful battle I had; but his sublime instructions taught
  me how to pray for the grace of God to guide me to his true
  Church. He was ever persecuted, and nobly overcame his
  enemies. I remember one morning when he was going his
  accustomed rounds to visit the poor and sick, he had to pass
  a boys' school, at Hill Top; they used to hoot after him low
  names, but, seeing he did not take any notice, they came
  into the road and threw mud and stones at him; he took no
  notice. Then they took hold of his coat, and ripped it up
  the back. He did not mind, but went on all day, as usual,
  through Oldbury, Tipton Oudley, and Hill Top, visiting his
  poor people. He used to leave home every morning, and
  fill his pockets with wine and food for the poor sick, and
  return home about six in the evening, without taking any
  refreshment all day, though he might have walked twenty miles
  in the heat of summer. One winter's day he gave all his
  clothes away to the poor, except those that were on him.
  He used to say two Masses on Sunday, in West Bromwich,
  and preach. I never saw him use a conveyance of any kind
  in his visits through his parish."
</p>
<p>
It could not be expected that the newspapers would keep
silence about him. He gets a little in that way, which he
writes about, as follow:&mdash;"Eliot (an apostate) has been
writing in divers quarters that I know of, and I dare say in
many others (for he was very fond of letter-writing), the most
violent abuse of the Catholic Church, and of all her priests,
excepting me, whom he pities as a wretched victim of priest-craft.
I still hope there is some strange infatuation about
him which may dissipate, and let him return; but if not,
the Church has ramparts enough to stand his battering, and
I am not afraid of my little castle being shaken by him. I
feel desirous rather than not that he should publish the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
worst he can about me and mine in the Protestant papers.
It will help to correct us of some faults, and bring to light,
perhaps, at the same time, something creditable to our
cause."
</p>
<p>
He must have felt the extraordinary change in his state
of mind and duty now to what he experienced some four or
five years before. There are no doubts about doctrines, nor
difficulties about Dissenters; his way is plain and clear,
without mist or equivocal clause; there is but one way for
Catholics of being united with heretics&mdash;their unconditional
submission to the Church. There is no going half-way to
meet them, or sacrificing of principles to soothe their
scruples; either all or none&mdash;the last definition of the
Council of Trent, as well as the first article of the Apostles'
Creed. If he has difficulties about any matter, he will not
find Bishops giving him shifting answers, and seemingly
ignorant themselves of what is the received interpretation
of a point of faith. He will be told at once by the next
priest what is the doctrine of the Church, and if he refuses
to assent to it he ceases to be a Catholic. This looks an
iron rule in the Church of God, and those outside her
cannot understand how its very unbending firmness consoles the
doubtful, cheers the desponding, strengthens the will and
expands and nourishes the intellect.
</p>
<p>
A priest has many consolations in his little country parish
that few can understand or appreciate. It is not the number
and efficiency of his schools, the round of his visits, or the
frequency of his instructions. No; it is the offering of the
Victim of Salvation every morning for his own and his
people's sins, and it is the conveying the precious blood
of his Saviour to their souls, through the Sacraments he
administers. Only a priest can understand what it is to feel
that a creature kneels before him, steeped in vice and sin,
and, after a good confession, rises from his knees, restored to
God's grace and friendship. All his labours have this one
object&mdash;the putting of his people into the grace of God, and
keeping them in it until they reach to their reward. There
is a reality in all this which faith alone can give that makes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
him taste and feel the good he is doing. A reality that will
make him fly without hesitation to the pestilential deathbed,
and glory in inhaling a poison that may end his own days, in
the discharge of his duty. He must be ever ready to give
his life for his sheep, not in fancy or in words, but in very
deed, and thus seal by his martyrdom both the truth which
he professes, and his love for the Master whom he has been
chosen to serve.
</p>
<p>
The number of priests who die every year, and the average
of a missionary priest's life, prove but too clearly how
often the sacrifice is accepted.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>CHAPTER V.<br>
Prospects Of Widening His Sphere Of Action.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Towards the close of the year 1834, Earl Spencer died.
George, of course, felt it deeply; he loved his father with,
if possible, more than filial affection, for he could look up
since his childhood to his paternal example; and all the
virtue he was able to practise during his younger days,
despite the occasions into which he was cast, he attributed
chiefly to the influence of his father's authority. The
country lost a statesman, and the Catholics an advocate in
the noble earl; his death was therefore regretted by more
than his immediate family; but there was one great reason
why his son felt so deeply&mdash;his father had not died a Catholic.
There were many things to make up for his exclusion from
the <i>mementoes</i> of his son in the mass, as not being one of
those <i>qui nos praecesserunt cum signo fidei</i>; such as, his real
natural goodness, his acting up to his lights, and his kind
treatment of his son; but they were, of course, poor, weak
assuagements to the stern fact that he could not pray publicly
for the repose of his soul, and only, by the merest conditional
permission, even privately. Father Spencer goes shortly
after to Althorp. The new earl thinks proper to prohibit
his brother speaking to any except those of his own rank
while visiting there. He had, of course, his reasons, but it
was a sore trial to Father Spencer, who ever loved the poor,
and never felt so happy as when exercising his patience in
listening to the detailed account of their sufferings, or in
trying to relieve them by words or alms. He put up with
it, and a <i>thank God</i> soon made him at home amid lords and
ladies for the time of his short stay.
</p>
<p>
It may strike some person as a very strange thing that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
this illustrious convert and great saint, as he really was and
appeared to be, should be shut up in a poor hamlet whose
name does not appear even on railway maps, and not located
in some resort of pride and fashion. But the Honourable
and Reverend George Spencer had seen enough of fashion
and gentility to be thoroughly disgusted with both the one
and the other. He understood no way of going to heaven
except that which Our Lord pointed out to us and went
Himself first for us to follow, the way of the cross in poverty
and humility. Hence he applied to Bishop Walsh for the
poorest and worst mission in the diocese. If one will not
be inclined to give this good Bishop credit for forwarding
the apostolical intentions of his young priest, let him know
that there might be also a more inferior motive why he
should accede to his request. Priests with private incomes
can better subsist in poor missions than those who depend
on the charity of their flocks; and we find at present that
many, who have property of their own, are appointed,
notwithstanding the honourable and creditable prefixes to their
names, to missions which are not able to support a priest
from their internal resources. These two reasons put
together will account for the placing of the Hon. and Rev.
George Spencer in the mission of West Bromwich.
</p>
<p>
St. Thomas defines zeal, "an intense love by which one is
moved against and repels whatever is detrimental to the
good of his friend, and does his best to prevent whatever is
against the honour or the will of God." Alphonsus Rodrigues
says: "It is the love of God on fire, and a vehement
desire that He should be loved, honoured, and adored by
all; and so intense is it, that he who burns therewith tries
to communicate its heat to every one." This effect of zeal
is the special gleam by which the shining of great saints can
be distinguished from ordinary servants of God. They are
filled with the love of God, they overflow with it, and dash
off floods that sweep down vice and sin by their impetuosity.
When obstacles occur to show that the time is not opportune,
or that the sluices should not yet be drawn, the saints
are far from languishing into ordinary ways. No; the
springs are open afresh, their hearts are filling the more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
they are pent up, and seek avenues on every side and
in every way in which they may possibly allow some
heavenly water to escape. Such was the zeal of St. Chrysostom,
who would be blind if his audience could but see.
Such was the love of St. Francis Xavier, who went through
unknown and almost inaccessible regions to convert the
heathen. Such was the love of St. Teresa, who sighed that
she was not a man, because her sex and state forbade her to
be an apostle. Such was the Psalmist, when he said, "The
zeal of Thy house has eaten me up."
</p>
<p>
The difference between heavenly zeal and fanaticism is,
that one is willing to be directed, the other breaks the bonds
of authority. One acts sweetly and consistently, the other
intemperately and rashly. One distrusts self, the other
begins and ends with self.
</p>
<p>
Father Spencer was full of zeal. It was, in fact, his zeal
that brought him into the Church. Now that he found
himself commissioned to propagate God's kingdom, his zeal
arose to that of the saints, and began to burst forth and
devise means by which that kingdom could be speedily and
perfectly spread. He devised plans for the sanctification of
the clergy by introducing a kind of religious life amongst
them; he formed plans for the perfection of the laity, after
an old but abandoned model, which will be described; he
had conceived plans of founding a religious institute, of
which a devout soul he knew was to be first rev. mother;
he had plans of preaching, away at some place or places
which he does not tell us about; he had plans for finding
out the secret by which the Jesuits became such successful
missionaries; he had plans of going to Cambridge for an
installation, and bearding the lion of heresy and error in
his very den;&mdash;and all these he proposed from time to time
to his director and diocesan superior, but all met the one
fate of being drowned by the cold water thrown upon them.
He complains a little, in a letter he wrote at this time, of
"the slowness of Catholic prelates with regard to schemes;"
but after being told to lay them aside, he resigns himself with
perfect submission. He finds out, in a short time, that the
Catholic prelates were right, and he drops his wings completely,
by saying: "I am resolved to give up forming plans
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
for the future, and I shall try to gain more love of God and
devotion to the Blessed Virgin. This again He must give me,
and Mary must gain it for me; or rather, I must charge her
to persevere in making this request for me, whether I forget
it occasionally or not." Besides the crossing of his plans, he
has another cross to endure; he loves to visit Hagley, where
Lady Lyttelton, his sister, generally lived, and he is received
only on condition that he will not speak of religion. This he
feels hard, as he loved this sister very much, and thought he
could not show a greater proof of his affection than that of
communicating to her, if possible, what he prized more than
his life&mdash;his faith.
</p>
<p>
One plan he forms, however, which does not meet with
the disapproval of his superiors, and that was, to go to
London and beg among his aristocratic friends for funds for
a new church he intended building at Dudley. He seems
to have succeeded pretty well, as there is a nice gothic
church there at present, which was built by him. We have
only one peculiar incident of his first begging tour.
</p>
<p>
He took it into his head to go and ask a subscription of
the Duchess of Kent, mother to our Queen. He was received
kindly by the Duchess, and the Princess Victoria was
allowed to be present at the conversation. Father Spencer
spoke for some time about the lamentable state of England,
on account of its religious divisions; he gave a short account
of his own conversion, and wound up by putting forward
the claims of the Catholic Church to the obedience of all
Christians, as there ought to be but one fold under one
shepherd. It may be said that he formed a very favourable
opinion of the Princess from this meeting; he said once,
when relating the story: "I considered the Princess very
sensible and thoughtful. She listened with great attention
to everything I said, and maintained a respectful silence,
because she sat beside her mother. I had great hopes of her
then, and so far they have not been disappointed. I hope
ye will all pray for her, and we may one day have the pleasure
of seeing her a Catholic." This he said in 1863, and
then he was firmly convinced that the Duchess herself had
died a Catholic.
</p>
<p>
He returned soon to his mission in West Bromwich, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
writes, in a letter to Mr. Phillipps: "I had a project in my
head when I returned, more extensive than any that filled
it of late. That is, going to Dublin to see if there I might
find some unknown mine out of which I could draw what I
want for Dudley. This soon grew into the thought of a
tour round Ireland, and the subject of collecting alms for
Dudley soon began to look trivial and secondary. I could
hardly contain myself at the thoughts of preaching all over
Ireland the conversion of England, and exhorting them all
to forget their earthly miseries in the view of our spiritual
ones, and to begin to retaliate the evils they have endured
in the way of the true Christian, not by violent opposition,
but by rendering good a thousandfold, or rather beyond
reckoning." This scheme was put off for some time, by
the advice of the Rev. Mr. Martyn, who seems to have been
his director.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning of August, 1835, Father Spencer got a
severe attack of illness: it proceeded principally from over-exertion.
He began to spit blood, and as soon as his friends
heard of it, his sister, Lady Lyttelton, and his brother-in-law,
Lord George Quin, came for him and took him to
Hagley, where he might be carefully nursed until he should
recover. They set him down to say mass in Stourbridge,
and allowed him all the spiritual aid he wished for, even
going so far as to invite a priest to come and stay with him,
and make Hagley his home for the time. This was in keeping
with their usual kindness, and Father Spencer never
forgot it; nay, he would treasure up the least act of kindness
done him by any one, much more so when received from
those who differed from him in religious matters. He
writes now, apparently under the shadow of death: one
thing looks strange to him when he thinks of dying, that
he cannot see why God gives him such a strong desire for
an apostolic life if it be not sometime carried into effect.
"It may be that He will give me the merit of the desires
without their accomplishment, but this seems less probable.
His will be done. I only mention this to prevent your
being discouraged on my account. What is an illness in His
sight? It is easier to restore me my vigour than at first to
give it to me. Let us only wait prepared for quick
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
obedience to His call, whether for this world or the next." In
another letter, written about the same time, he says:
"What I am further to do must be decided by my present
<i>bodily</i> director, Dr. Johnstone, to whom for my correction
and humiliation the Bishop has committed me."
</p>
<p>
It seems most likely that he wrote the autobiography
during this illness; it has the marks and tokens of his then
state of mind upon the first part of it at least.
</p>
<p>
After his recovery there is talk of his being made a
bishop, and some of his friends are doing their best, by
writing and so forth, to help his promotion to the mitre. No
better idea can be given of the way he felt with regard to
this matter, than by introducing a letter he wrote at the
time to one of his friends:
</p>
<p class="cite">
"I know you are as eager about
everything that concerns me as about your own matters;
and that you are now boiling to come and be busy about
this most interesting affair. Yet it will prove better to go
on quietly. To be sure I should exult if it please God
of His own will to enlarge my powers and faculties of
advancing His kingdom, trusting to Him to furnish me with
graces sufficient; but the call must be clear, and His will
manifest, or, I thank God, I have made up my mind to
answer, I stir not. And how can I know this but by the
rule of obedience? Many reasons strike me <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>.
immediately; but these I had better not meditate upon. I
shall leave it to Dr. Walsh to decide whether I accept or do
not. I cannot be right any other way. If he chooses to
hear me plead the cause for myself, stating what I think
are the motives <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>.,
I will do it when he likes; if
not, it is certainly better not to go against him. I was at
Prior Park three years ago, when Dr. Baines knows that I
refused the offer of an Irish clergyman to propose me for
an Irish bishopric, on Dr. Walsh's judgment, and he approved
of that decision. No doubt he will of this."
</p>
<p>
We hear nothing further of this, so it is likely Dr.
Walsh judged it proper for him to refuse the contemplated
honour.
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br>
Newspaper Discussions, Etc.</h2>
<br>
<p>
From the end of the year 1835 to the middle of 1836,
Father Spencer was more or less engaged in newspaper
controversy with some ministers. The first champion of Protestantism,
or rather assailant of Catholicism, he condescended
to argue with was a Mr. Gideon Ouseley. This gentleman
is described in a letter written at the time as a "Low
Church parson, or Methodist, of Armagh." There may be
some distinction between the two characters, but it is only
fair to say that we freely grant him the benefit of the
doubt. They had a paper fight about the usual topics of
controversy, beginning with mis-statements of doctrine from
Mr. Ouseley and explanations from Mr. Spencer, and continuing
through a very brisk parrying of logical thrusts to
a conclusion which ended by the newspaper refusing to
insert any more letters. Some good effects may have been
produced by the controversy, which seldom happens, and
also some breaches of charity; but there is one circumstance
worthy to be mentioned, though perhaps it cannot
well be traced back to <i>The Watchman</i> newspaper, that this
same Rev. Gideon Ouseley is, at the time these pages are
writing, the officiating chaplain of the <i>soi-disant</i> monks of
Norwich, Br. Ignatius and his companions.
</p>
<p>
The next adversary was a Mr. Dalton. Father Spencer
expends some very good arguments on him, among others,
the following in the first letter: "You and other Protestants
may say that they consider this doctrine (transubstantiation)
unscriptural; but the arguments by which you endeavour to
impugn it never are scriptural. I once used to argue against
it myself, and the best arguments I could find were from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
reason." There may be fault found with this argument,
because a thing could be unscriptural, though its denial or
refutation were not; but F. Spencer establishes the positive
side of the question afterwards. And the argument was
good thus far that its denial is an Article of the 39, which
should be proved by "sure warranty of Scripture." He
does so in a passage which begins thus: "If Scripture be
appealed to simply, I know not how any one can deny that
it speaks altogether in our favour, whenever the Eucharist
is mentioned or alluded to. When we are asked for proofs
of our doctrine we invariably begin by an appeal to the
simple words of Christ given in Scripture. 'This is my body,'
'This is my blood,' which, taken as they stand, can agree
with no doctrine but the Catholic."
</p>
<p>
F. Spencer thought he had a gentleman to deal with in
his adversary, but found that he had overrated the attributes
his charity supposed him to possess. He pointed an argument
upon the unity of our teachers as contradistinguished from
sectarian ones, by bringing in Mr. Dalton and his brother
us an example. At this Dalton took offence, and F. Spencer
made a most ample and beautiful apology. This evoked all
the bile of his opponent in a flourish of trumpets, by which
he boasted of a post relinquished in the argument, which
really argued gain in F. Spencer as a Christian antagonist.
He flung out then in glorious confusion&mdash;imperfect councils,
bad popes, Spanish inquisitions, just as they came to hand.
When Spencer saw this, he thought of answering him according
to his folly, and instead of analyzing his "concentrated
lozenge," wrote something in the style of cudgelling
him for the fun of the thing next time. Here is an extract
from his next letter, which is produced more as a specimen
of his humour than of his logic:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
A sentence of Mr. Dalton's letter ran thus:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But let
  me first remind you what our view of private judgment is.
  Do we mean that every man may set up as an interpreter
  of Scripture, that every shoemaker and ploughman (as
  Catholics say) may become a preacher? By no means; we
  recognise authority when it is scriptural, and believe that an
  authorized ministry is God's mode of extending the Bible."
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
<p>
Father Spencer replies:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Now this sentence suggests
  so many reflections to me that I hardly know which way to
  begin with it. I will first try what a little paraphrase will
  do, and explain what I think might perchance have been in
  your mind when you wrote it, and you may tell me whether
  I am near the mark before I make further comments on it.
  I would figure you to myself as reasoning thus with your
  self:&mdash;The right of private judgment must be maintained
  in some form, or else even we ministers shall not be able to
  stand our ground against the Romanists. If we allow of
  any reasonable notion of Church authority when we talk to
  them, they will hook us up again, and we shall not be able
  to assert even our own liberty to interpret as we like. But,
  on the other hand, if we put away talking of Church authority
  when we mount our pulpits, and impart the word to
  our hitherto obedient poor followers, they will begin to ask
  themselves, what need, then, is there of our reverend
  guides? Why should we pay any more tithes, and seat
  rents, and church rates, and Easter offerings, and the like?
  Yea! then would be sad danger that our craft would come
  to be set at nought, and the Temple of Great Diana (the
  Church of Great Elizabeth) would be reputed for nothing,
  and therefore we must teach people that there is such a
  thing as ministerial authority at least, if we cannot make
  much of an attempt to prove ecclesiastical authority; we
  must take care to maintain that to be capable of being a
  minister, a man must be able to read the New Testament in
  Greek, and the Old in Hebrew, at least, have a smattering
  of Hebrew, or else we shall have shoemakers and plough-men
  setting up opposition without being able to put them
  down; for they will be able to match us in what we must
  hold forth as the grand proof of the ministry, viz., that a
  man should be able to quote texts at pleasure, and talk
  about them so rapidly and unintelligibly as to make a
  congregation think him mighty wise and deeply spiritual.
  Such are the men who must be proclaimed worthy of great
  honour and admiration, but, above all, of ample revenues.
  Never mind how many contradictory systems enter into
  their respective reverend heads, we must persuade the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
  people, as long as they will swallow it, that they all speak
  by the Holy Ghost. It would, indeed, be more according
  to Scripture and reason, if all who professed to be led by
  the Spirit taught one doctrine; but this we can never bring
  about, unless we all get back to popery: and, indeed, it is
  not needful, nor even expedient, for the purpose we have
  before us, which is not to speak sound words which cannot
  be reproved, but such words as will keep together our congregation,
  and suit their tastes. Now as the tastes of men
  are so various, it is absolutely necessary that the doctrines
  we give them should vary too, and, therefore, as we know
  that Bible truth is but one, and the Bible, nevertheless, is
  the book out of which we must all pretend to teach, we
  cannot sufficiently praise the cleverness of those gifted
  individuals, who, by organizing a sort of skirmishing ministry,
  to take the place of the old uniform heavy phalanx of the
  Romanists, one fit <i>to extend the truth of the Bible</i>, so as to
  suit the tastes of all sorts of men, have enabled so many of
  us to extract from the pockets of all a genteel maintenance
  for our wives and families. I have in this paraphrase
  found myself obliged to pass over one word when you speak
  of <i>God's</i> mode of <i>extending</i> the truth of the Bible. This
  operation, I think, God had never anything to do with. I
  believe that 1,800 years ago, God did, by his only Son,
  institute a ministry as his mode of <i>preserving</i> the truth of
  the Bible, but <i>extending</i> the truth of the Bible is a very
  different sort of affair. These words, though rather obscure,
  yet seem to convey very felicitiously the idea of what the
  Gospel ministers of the present day have accomplished, that
  is, making the Bible truth so extensive as to embrace all
  the various contradictory systems&mdash;Church of England,
  High, Low, Evangelical, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>. But the time
  would fail me to tell a tenth part of the glorious variety
  which the spiritual bill of fare of the nineteenth century
  presents to the dainty taste of our countrymen. This plan
  of truth extension is a wonder which was reserved for the
  wisdom of our preachers to contrive and to develope, under
  the guidance of a wiser spirit than that of man, and yet
  certainly not the spirit of God. The ancient saints had no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
  more idea of it than Archimedes had of a hydraulic press.
  I have taken the liberty of playing upon your exposition of
  authority, to show how vain it is to attempt to uphold anything
  like a legitimate authority, and the right of private
  judgment together. I do not wonder that you got rather
  into a perplexity in trying to explain how they may be
  reconciled. The Church of England has tried to explain
  this matter in her 20th Article, but finds it too hard. She
  just says, 'the Church hath authority in controversies of
  faith,' but leaves it to her children to guess whether this
  authority be divine or human, infallible or fallible, granted
  her by the King of Heaven or the king of England. She
  intimates, indeed, that it is not quite to be depended on, by
  the next words, in which it is said, 'it is not lawful for the
  Church to ordain anything contrary to God's word written:'
  but again we are left to divine who the judge is, who is to
  keep the Church in order: is it the king, or every licensed
  preacher, or every single Christian? ..... Ah! these
  Articles are troublesome things. I have known what it is
  to be under those shackles, and what it is to be set free
  from them."
</p>
<p>
In the next letter, his opponent complains that Father
Spencer has <i>hurt his feelings</i>, and made his <i>heart sicken</i>,
which complaint the <i>wily priest</i>, as he was termed, began to
answer thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have heard of certain ladies who have
  recourse to a method something like this to escape being
  kept in order by their husbands, and who silence everything
  that is said against their humours by falling into hysterics.
  A tender husband will once or twice perhaps be melted by
  the alarming spectacle; he will run and fetch the smelling-bottle,
  ring for the servants, beg pardon, and say pretty
  things to compose his dear partner's mind again. But when
  he finds that as soon as she has gained her point she gets
  well directly, and is more saucy and wilful than before&mdash;if
  he wishes to be happy, or to make her so&mdash;he will be what
  she calls cruel next time, and let her get well by herself till
  she is tired of fainting fits. Now, sir, I have once been
  tender-hearted over you .... I apologized ....
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
  In the next letter you took advantage of this to make an
  impertinent remark. This discovered to me that your feelings
  need not be so tenderly dealt with, and I proceeded
  with my disagreeable questions, and shall still do so at the
  risk of your telling me in the next letter that I have not
  only sickened you, but made you quite faint away."
</p>
<p>
After thus sickening his delicate friend, he sums up in the last
letter and answers the difficulties objected to him very well
indeed. We forbear introducing purely controversial matter,
except in as far as it bears upon the peculiar gifts or manner
of Father Spencer. There is nothing but what any ordinary
priest of fair acquirements could have said in defence of our
doctrines in the remainder, except that the answer to the
hackneyed objection about some councils being of doubtful
authority is very clearly and forcibly given.
</p>
<p>
A third champion entered the lists before these had been
"conquered" enough to think themselves qualified "to argue
still." This was a Rev. W. Riland Bedford. Indeed, he
was so impatient of distinguishing himself by the honour of
having once engaged with so respectable a foe, that he could
not wait until Mr. Dalton was ousted. Besides, it is very
likely he thought Mr. Dalton was missing fine opportunities
of giving clever strokes, by spending too much time in
quarrelling with the ungenerous hits of his adversary or,
perhaps, he thought he did not take the proper instruments
of warfare. However, he made a grand stroke, and aimed
also at what he believed to be the most vulnerable, as well
as the most defenceless, spot in the person of F. Spencer's
system. Here we might be corrected by the <i>Maid of Lille</i>,
who said, very pertly, to Mr. Spencer once: "Catholics have
no systems." They have doctrines. At all events, Mr.
Riland Bedford did attack F. Spencer, and lest he might
lose by being single-handed, a brace of them&mdash;Revs. Messrs.
M'Ghee and himself&mdash;made an onslaught on Revs. Messrs.
M'Donnel and Spencer, thereby intending, of course, to make
a grand breach in Popery. The subject of their letters was
the treating of certain sins by our moral theologians.
F. Spencer made use of the usual line of defence here, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
he added also an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>. "St. Paul, in
the chapter above referred to (Rom. i.), tells us that there
were no sins more prevalent in his day, and none more destructive,
than that grievous class of sins to which these
questions relate. The afflicting experience of the pastors
of the Church leads them to fear that no less awfully in
these times and in this country, do habits of the like
crimes make ruin of thousands of souls; and <i>your own recollection
of the University, where, I suppose, you were educated
for holy orders, must convince you that our fears are
not unfounded. For what must be expected in the body of
the people, when, among those who are preparing to be their
pastors, at the most critical time of their life, there are so few
who dare openly to withstand the prevailing fashion of
iniquity, and so many who profess to despise morality and
chastity as a thing to be ashamed of.</i>" F. Spencer was
tripped up in some allusions he made to a Protestant
attempt at a prayer-book, of which there were two or three
editions; but, since he happened not to be correct as to
one edition, and to miss something about another, still,
though his argument was not thereby weakened, but Rev.
Mr. Riland Bedford thought it was, and so, or nearly so,
the matter ended.
</p>
<p>
F. Spencer was induced to begin this paper controversy
by the hope of conveying some information about Catholic
dogmas to those who would not read Catholic books, but
would, and did, read newspapers. Shortly after, he learnt,
by one instance, what little good generally comes of this
kind of contention. He paid a visit to Hagley, and, in a
conversation with Lord Lyttelton, asked him if he had seen
the <i>Birmingham Gazette</i> lately. "Yes," replied the other,
"but delicacy forbade me to allude to your share in that
concern." The sum of it was that his lordship thought
George under a perfect delusion, and wondered he was not
confounded at such powerful refutations as his adversary's
were. All F. Spencer wrote looked to him perfectly trifling;
so much so, that he had made up his mind to take George
in hand himself, and convert him back again, and was then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
actually getting up some little theology to aid him in doing
so more summarily. This George took in very good
humour, and hoped good from, especially as Lord Lyttelton
appeared to be the leader in the family in point of
religion. He was doomed to a sad disappointment; for
Lord Lyttelton died shortly after this conversation, and, as
far as documentary evidence goes, without having had
another conversation with Father Spencer.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br>
Private Life And Crosses Of F. Spencer.</h2>
<br>
<p>
It could scarcely be supposed that the self-denying, laborious
life of F. Spencer in West Bromwich, which has been already
alluded to, could be one of those effervescent fits that pass
away with the newness of change, when one remembers his
life as a Protestant minister. He did not abate one iota of
his mortifications or labours, but he became systematized
with them, and managed, under the advice of his director,
to keep from extremes. He no longer scrupled paying for
a conveyance, if he thought the object of his journey was
worth more than the coach-fare. For letters, he followed
the same rule, though, as he was in a position to obtain
franks very frequently, he had not so much difficulty to put
up with in the matter of paying heavy postage. To bear
these remarks out, we have some of his own letters, but the
letter of a lady, who made his acquaintance some time about
1835, and had frequent opportunities of observing him up
to the time of his becoming a Passionist, will be more
satisfactory than snatches of sentences here and there, which
accidentally tell what he was doing.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "In the year 1835 I first became acquainted with the
  Catholic religion, and, in consequence, with the Hon. and
  Rev. George Spencer, who instructed and afterwards received
  me into the Church. From that time till the present
  I never for a moment doubted of his extraordinary sanctity.
  He never in all his discourses with me, which were numerous,
  spoke of anything but with an aim to the glory of God. I
  knew his housekeeper at West Bromwich, a very good
  woman, who has been dead many years. She told me that
  she many times found him, very early in the morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
  cleaning his own shoes, and she dare not let him see her for
  fear of confusion. She often remarked that he spent a very
  long time in the exercise of prayer and meditation. He was
  so zealous for the salvation of souls that whenever he saw
  any new comer in his chapel he would find them out, go to
  their houses and speak with them; he thus brought many into
  the Church. Although he was insulted in all kinds of ways,
  on his walks, he rejoiced and thanked God for all. When
  he opened his mission in Dudley, rather than go to a public
  inn he slept, wrapped up in a large rough cloak, on the bare
  floor of what served as for sacristy, and continued to do so
  for some time until he had a proper place prepared. Many
  nights at his own home he used to disturb the bed a little,
  but it was found that he had not lain in it at all for the
  whole night. When he was instructing me in the year
  1836, he broke a blood-vessel, and though the blood literally
  flowed from his head into a dish, he continued on the
  instructions. He visited the sick constantly. On one occasion
  he went to see a poor woman, who had not one to
  attend her; she became very restless whilst he was there,
  and wanted to go downstairs; he wrapped her up in a
  blanket and carried her down. She was no sooner down
  than she wanted to be brought up again; he brought her up,
  too; she got quiet then, listened to him, and after a short
  time expired before he left the room.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "At one house where he visited, a child was suffering from
  a bad mouth, so that it was quite distressing to look at it.
  Father Spencer laid his finger on the child's tongue, and
  said, 'It will be well;' in a half-an-hour afterwards it was
  quite well. Once my grandmother was at the point of
  death; he came and blessed her, and in a day or two she
  was quite well." Miraculous cures are wrought very frequently
  by priests' blessings. "Whatever thou blessest shall
  be blessed," is not pronounced in vain at their ordination;
  and "we must," as Father Ignatius would say pointedly to
  those who reflected little on them, "remember that our
  Lord's words do deserve some little attention." Faith can
  remove mountains, and it is only proper and just that faith
  could do something less. Since the faith of the person
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
  "made whole" is often as powerful as the faith of the
  servant of God, each side escapes the vanity of having
  wrought wonders, by attributing the effect to the other.
  "He generally went to the kitchen himself, or other places, to
  get what he wanted, and would often do without a thing,
  rather than trouble his housekeeper or a servant, if he knew
  them to be engaged. He wished to be not only his own
  servant, but the servant of everybody as far as he could.
  He used to beg of my father and me to pray that he might
  become poorer than the poorest man we ever knew. He
  even once asked my father to pray that he might become so
  poor as to be compelled to <i>lie down and die in a ditch</i>. I
  never saw him out of heart or in the least discouraged,
  however difficult a case he might come across: he would
  generally say, 'We must go on, rejoice and thank God; it
  will all come right in the end.' One of his former high-up
  friends and he were walking by a lunatic asylum once, and
  his friend remarked that he should soon be fit for admission
  there. This he used to relate with as great glee as if he
  had received a first-rate compliment, perhaps greater. When
  he visited our house in the country once, he struck his head
  against a beam somewhere, and I was astonished at hearing
  him exclaim, 'Served me right.'"
</p>
<p>
Several dear friends die about this time, and the conflict
between affection and religious detachment is beautifully
pourtrayed in the yielding of the former to the latter by
several remarks of his own and others, which we subjoin.
</p>
<p>
He hears of the death of Cardinal Weld about the beginning
of the year 1837, and thus writes to Mr. Phillipps
about it: "You have heard, of course, of Cardinal Weld's
death. I have felt that it is to me like the loss of a father
almost; for he treated me as a child, as no doubt he did a
great many more. But we must not give way to sorrows,
for we have enough to do with our feelings in the battle
against present evils, without wasting them on evils which
are irremediable." The next death he heard of was that of
the Honourable George Quin, a nephew of his, and he wrote
to Mr. Phillipps: "That is another warning to us to pray
better for the remainder, when one of our four families is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
carried off before the fruit of our prayers appears." Somewhere
about this time Lord Lyttelton dies also, without
having succeeded in the project he formed last year, nor did
poor Father Spencer succeed much in bringing him over to
his side. He always respected this good brother-in-law, and
the feeling was returned. He felt greatly for his loss, as
well as for the bereavement of his sister. To add to his
trials, a change comes over the relations between him and
his family. Hitherto it was stipulated that Father Spencer
was to be always received as a welcome guest provided he
never spoke on religious subjects. The Bishop thinks it, as
of course it was, unfair to place restrictions upon him, and
not leave the matter to his own discretion. It was not quite
becoming for a priest to pay visits, and keep his lips closed
by contract on everything that was proper to his sacred
character. On the other hand, the family did not like to
have their agreeable parties disturbed by controversy, which
was likely to draw out hotter words than was suitable to the
state of things. Both sides had some kind of reason to
show, and Father Spencer was placed between them. He
communicated the decision of his bishop to the more influential
members of the Spencer family, but he found they
would not bend. He cheerfully gives up visiting, and even
consoles some of his friends who manifest their concern that
he should be debarred a pleasure so innocent and apparently
so justifiable. How much he felt this, notwithstanding his
cheerful resignation, may be seen from the following testimony,
of one who knew him well, to the affection he had for
Lady Lyttelton, his sister, who still survives:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "In the year 1837 Mr. Mackey (Mrs. Mackey writes the
  letter) was engaged painting a picture for Father Ignatius,
  for his chapel at West Bromwich, and we saw a great deal
  of him. He was devotedly attached to his sister, Lady
  Lyttelton, and he often used to speak of her loving care of him
  when a boy; and once, when I quoted those lines of Gray:&mdash;
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
<pre>
      "'See the wretch that long was toss'd
        On the stormy bed of pain,
      At once regain his vigour lost,
        And breathe and walk again.

      The meanest note that swells the gale,
        The simplest flower that scents the dale,
      The common sun, the air, the skies,
        To him are opening Paradise&mdash;'
</pre>
<p class="cite">
  he was much affected, and said he had not heard them since
  his sister, Lady Lyttelton, repeated them to him after
  recovering from an illness when he was young. There was,
  also, a song he sang occasionally at our house, because she
  liked it, and had taught it to him. He sang it with such
  feeling that it always moved me to tears, and as soon as I
  heard of his death I began to sing it, and it kept recurring
  to me all day. I seemed to rejoice for him in the song.
  These are the words: they are Moore's:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
      "'The bird, let loose in Eastern skies,
        When hastening fondly home,
      Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies
        Where idle warblers roam.

      But high she shoots through air and light,
        Above all low delay:
      Where nothing earthly bounds her flight,
        Nor shadow dims her way.

      So grant me, Lord, from ev'ry care,
        And stain of passion free,
      Aloft through virtue's nobler air,
        To wing my course to thee.

      No sin to cloud, no lure to stay,
        My soul as home she springs,
      Thy sunshine on her joyful way,
        Thy freedom on her wings.'
</pre>
<p class="cite">
  He was always very much moved when speaking of Lady
  Lyttelton."
</p>
<p>
It was no small sacrifice to submit with cheerfulness to
the circumstances which prevented him visiting this sister,
now that she had become a widow and had need of a consoler
to help herself and children to bear their affliction.
He simply says: "I find all my crosses and vexations to be
blessings; and directly I made the sacrifice of feeling to duty,
God sent me the best set of catechumens I have had yet.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
Among others, a man and wife who have been <i>male</i> and
<i>female</i> preachers, among the Primitive Methodists, or
Ranters."
</p>
<p>
His great friend and director, the Rev. Mr. Martyn, was
the next of whose death he heard. This good and virtuous
priest was more than a friend to Father Spencer. He served
his novitiate to the work of the English mission, under his
direction in Walsall, for three months before he came to
West Bromwich. He had been his confessor and guide in
all his practices of piety until now. He managed his affairs
with as much interest as if they were his own; he was ever
ready with his counsel and assistance, and seems to have
taken the Dudley mission as soon as Father Spencer had
built the church there. Father Spencer preached his
funeral oration, and paid the last tribute of respect to his
mortal remains in the very spot where he so often profited
by his counsels. Here there was no cause of regret, except
for the good priest's widowed flock, for his saintly life gave
strong hopes of a blessed eternity.
</p>
<p>
It was said, in a former chapter, that he gave all his
money to the Bishop, and had sums given him now and
again, of which he returned an account at stated times, to
see if the way in which he spent them would be approved
of. It may be interesting to know how he kept these
accounts. Fortunately a few leaves of the book in which
they were noted have been found among his papers, and
from them we make the following extract:&mdash;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
Association Of Prayers For The Conversion Of England.</h2>
<br>
<p>
It was in the year 1838 that he began the great work to
which his life and energies were afterwards devoted&mdash;the
moving of the Catholics everywhere to pray conjointly for
the conversion of England. Before this time he and a few of
his friends prayed privately, said or heard masses for this
intention, and encouraged one another by letters and conversations
to perseverance in so holy a practice. Now he went
to work on a larger scale. How this change in the working
of his zeal was brought about will be best seen from a letter
he wrote to Dr. Briggs in November, 1838. Before, however,
quoting it, it may be well to remark that the cause of
his going to France with Mr. Phillipps was that he was
breaking down in health, hard-worked by two laborious
missions, for which he had no assistant since Mr. Martyn's
death, and that his doctor advised change of air and rest.
Here is the letter:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
    "London, <i>Nov</i>. 5, 1838.<br><br>

  "My Dear Lord,&mdash;I hope I shall be doing right to
  explain to your lordship the real circumstances of the
  transaction which, you may perhaps have been told, has
  been adverted to in <i>The Times</i> newspaper of Nov. 3, and
  some other paper since; which states, from the <i>Gazette de
  France,</i> that I have been at Paris, with Mr. Ambrose
  Phillipps, busy in establishing an association of prayers for
  the conversion of England to the Roman faith. I am
  certainly ready to plead guilty on this charge; but I do not
  find cause to repent of it. However, a good thing may be
  done so out of place and out of time as to make it not worth
  much, and it may be necessary, therefore, that I should
  explain myself before I am approved of in what I have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
  doing in Paris. In the first visit which I paid to the Archbishop
  on my arrival at Paris, I was saying, what I say
  continually, that what we want above all in England is
  good prayers; and that it would be a great benefit if the
  French would undertake to unite in prayer for us. I did
  not think of making any proposal for an actual arrangement
  of the kind till the Archbishop himself (then Monseigneur
  Quelin) encouraged, and almost obliged, me to do all I could
  by the zealous manner in which he took up the idea. He
  appointed that I should meet him after two days at St.
  Sulpice, where seventy or eighty of the clergy of Paris were
  to be assembled to offer him an address of thanks for a
  retreat which he had given them. After the business was
  concluded, he introduced me to them, and having explained
  how I came to be there, he proposed that they should undertake
  to pray for the conversion of England on every Thursday.
  The proposal was most favourably received, and I
  heard of its being acted upon by many offering their mass
  on the first Thursday. This encouraged me to go on. I
  obtained a circular letter of introduction to the superiors of
  religious houses, and visited about twenty of the principal.
  All of them undertook to offer their prayers as I asked
  them, and to write to their sister houses through France.
  The General of the Lazarists, and the Provincial of the
  Jesuits, undertook to recommend it to their brethren; but
  what I thought more satisfactory yet was, that all the Archbishops
  and bishops whom I could meet with in Paris
  promised to recommend the prayers in their dioceses and
  provinces; so that it appeared to me that there was reason
  to say that all France would soon be united in this prayer,
  and I trust other countries of Europe will follow their
  example. I remember, at the time when your lordship
  received me with much kindness at Halford House, on
  our speaking of the importance of prayers being regularly
  said for the conversion of England, and you told me of what
  had been done at Ushaw under your direction. I forget
  whether I said to you that I had then lately adopted the
  practice of offering my mass every Thursday regularly for
  that intention. I took this from the nuns of Mount
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
  Pavilion, with whom I had become acquainted the summer
  before, but especially what they do on Thursday, when
  there is high mass and exposition all the day, and a solemn
  act of reparation for the outrages committed against the
  Divine Eucharist. It seemed to me that this was a devotion
  peculiarly suited to the object of obtaining from
  Almighty God graces for England, one of whose most crying
  sins is; <i>the blasphemy of the Blessed Sacrament authorized by
  law for three centuries</i>.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I had only proposed the idea, however, to a few priests
  of my acquaintance, to unite in saying mass for England on
  that day, and was rather waiting for some plan to be suggested
  for a general union of prayers in England by some
  one of authority. But, as nothing had been done, and when
  I found myself engaged in this pursuit at Paris, it was
  necessary to propose something definite, I have nothing
  better than to request prayers from all the faithful for
  England, all days and at all times, but especially to offer
  mass on Thursday, if they be priests and at liberty, or communion,
  or assistance at mass, or visits to the Blessed Sacrament,
  or, in short, whatever they did for God, particularly
  on that day, for England's conversion.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The manner in which this request was accepted by all
  the good people whom I saw was most consoling to me;
  and it appears to me that I am bound to make it known in
  England, to those whose judgment is most important, and
  whose approval would most powerfully recommend the
  Catholics in England to correspond with the zealous spirit
  exhibited in behalf of our country by France.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is not for me to suggest to your lordship what might
  be done. I only venture to hope that you may think this
  matter perhaps worthy of your attention, and will perhaps
  mention it to the clergy as occasion may present itself. I
  would add, that in France the superiors of several seminaries
  were most ready to undertake to recommend it to the
  students, and it pleased me particularly to interest those
  communities in behalf of England, because the devotion
  might so well spread in that way through all classes. Would
  your lordship think fit to mention the subject at Ushaw?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
  I have nowhere asked for any particular prayers to be said
  as that might be burdensome; but simply that this intention
  might be thought of at least, if nothing more was done
  in reference to it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I beg again to be excused for my boldness in thus
  addressing you, and am your lordship's<br>
    "Obedient humble servant,<br>
      "George Spencer."
</p>
<p>
The passage he alludes to in <i>The Times</i> was as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The Hon. and Rev. George Spencer, brother to the present
  Earl, who was converted from Protestantism to the Catholic
  faith some years ago, has lately been passing some time at
  Paris, with Mr. Ambrose Phillipps, a gentleman of distinction
  of Leicestershire, eldest son of the late member for the
  northern division of the county. They have been busily
  occupied there in establishing an association of prayers for
  the conversion of this country to the Roman faith. They
  have had several interviews with the Archbishop of Paris
  on this subject, who has ordered all the clergy to say special
  prayers for this object in the <i>memento</i>. A number of the
  religious communities in France have already begun to
  follow the same practice."
</p>
<p>
This paragraph was taken up,
of course, and commented upon by the second-rate papers.
To be sure, the whole thing was magnified into nothing less
than a grand stir for a Papal aggression, which, if it did
not make the English shore glitter some day with French
bayonets, was certain to cram every workshop and church
with Jesuits in disguise.
</p>
<p>
The Bishops were all favourable to Father Spencer's zealous
ideas; they gave him leave to speak on the subject with all
the priests; they mentioned it in their pastorals: but they did
not wish him to go too publicly to work, as they rather feared
the spirit of the times, and did not know when another Gordon
riot might arise and overthrow what they had been building
up since the Emancipation. In the meantime, the work was
progressing rapidly. A Dutch journal reached him which let
him know that all the seminaries and convents in Holland
had given their Thursday devotions for England. A good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
priest wrote from Geneva to say that the programme should
be widened, and that all heretics and separatists ought to be
included as well as England. To this Father Spencer consented
after some deliberation, and in the space of about six
months all the Continent were sending up prayers for England's
conversion. He makes speeches at formal dinners
and public meetings, and always introduces this topic;
whereupon the reporters conceive a terrible rage, and puff
the matter into all the taverns and offices of London, Liverpool,
and Manchester. Of course, all this is accompanied
with gross misrepresentations and personal abuse. Of the
former point he thus speaks in a letter:&mdash;"The misrepresentations,
as far as I have seen them in the public papers,
by which they have endeavoured to obstruct the proposed
good, are so glaring that I think all thinking persons must
be benefited by reading them." "My notion was to ignore
the English public altogether, and go on with my work as
if it did not exist." "The opposite papers have certainly
helped me and well, in making the matter as public as
I could wish, without a farthing's cost to me, and in a
way in which I cannot be accused of being the immediate
agent of its publicity, as it was put about as though to
annoy me, but they are pleasing me without intending it."
This was the good-humoured way in which he took all that
was personal in the journalistic tirades. It gives one an
idea both of his great zeal and the great virtue with which
he accompanied it.
</p>
<p>
He now writes to the Irish Archbishops, and receives
very encouraging answers. So much did they enter into
his sentiments that, in a meeting of the Irish episcopate in
Dublin, they gave his proposals a good share of their attention,
and approved of them.
</p>
<p>
This he accounted great gain. It was the prayer of the
martyr for his persecutor, of Stephen for Saul, and of Our
Lord for the Jews. Poor Ireland had groaned and writhed
in Saxon bondage for centuries. She saw her children scattered
to the winds, or ground by famine and injustice
beneath the feet of the destroyer; and, at the voice of a
Saxon priest, she turned round, wiped the tear from her eye,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
pitied the blindness of her oppressor, and offered up her sufferings
to Heaven to plead for mercy for her persecutor. The cry
was a solemn universal prayer, framed by her spiritual leaders,
and carried to every fireside where the voice of the Church
could drown the utterings of complaint. F. Spencer thought
more of the prayers of the Irish than of all the Continent put
together; these were good, but those were heroic. He began
to love Ireland thenceforward with an ever-increasing love,
and trusted chiefly to the faith and sanctity of her children
for the fulfilment of his zealous intentions.
</p>
<p>
He pushed his exertions to Rome also, by writing to Dr.
Wiseman, and asking him to see the devotion carried out in
the Eternal City and the provinces. It met the same success
as in France, Belgium, Holland, and Ireland. There
is a letter extant which Dr. Wiseman wrote to F. Spencer
about this time (it is dated Ash Wednesday, 1839), and it
must be interesting, both for its intrinsic merit as well as
the giving an evidence of the harmony of feeling and sentiment
that bound the great cardinal and the zealous priest
together since their first acquaintance until they both went,
within a few months of each other, to enjoy the eternal reward
of their labours in England and elsewhere, for God's
glory:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
    "Rome, <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, 1839.<br><br>

  "My Dear Friend,&mdash;I must not delay any longer
  answering your kind and interesting letter. Its subject
  is one which has long occupied my thoughts, though I never
  contemplated the possibility of enlisting foreign Churches
  in prayer for it, but turned my attention more to exciting a
  spirit of prayer among ourselves. I will enter on the matter
  in hand with the most insignificant part of it, that is, my
  own feelings and endeavours, because I think they may encourage
  you and suggest some thoughts upon the subject.
  In our conference this time last year, I spoke very strongly
  to the students upon the wants of England, and the necessity
  of a new system in many things. One of the points on
  which I insisted was the want of systematic prayer for the
  conversion of England, and, at the same time, of <i>reparation</i>
  for her defection. I observed that it is the only country
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
  which has <i>persisted in</i> and <i>renewed</i>, in every generation,
  <i>formal acts of apostacy</i>, exacting from every sovereign, in
  the name of the nation, and from all that aspired to office
  or dignity, specific declarations of their holding Catholic
  truths to be superstitious and idolatrous. This, therefore,
  assumes the form of a national sin of blasphemy and heresy&mdash;not habitual, but actual; it is a bar to the Divine blessing,
  an obstacle of a positive nature to God's grace. It calls for
  contrary <i>acts</i>, as explicit and as formal, to remove its bad
  effects. Now what are the points on which this blasphemous
  repetition of national apostacy has fastened? They are chiefly
  two: Transubstantiation and the worship of the Blessed Virgin.
  These, consequently, are the points towards which the reparation
  and, for it, the devotion of Catholics should be directed
  in England. I therefore proposed, and have continued to
  inculcate this two-fold devotion, to our students on every
  occasion. I have for a year made it my daily prayer that I
  might be instrumental in bringing back devotion to the
  Blessed Eucharist, its daily celebration, frequent Communion,
  and <i>public</i> worship in England; and, at the same time,
  devotion to the Blessed Virgin, chiefly <i>through the propagation
  of the Rosary</i>. (My reasons for the choice of the Rosary
  I shall, perhaps, not be able to explain in this letter.) Allow
  me to mention, as I write to you, quite confidentially, that
  the idea struck me one afternoon that I happened to be
  alone in the Church of St. Eustachio, observing that the
  altar of the Blessed Sacrament was that of the Madonna;
  this led me to earnestly praying on the subject of uniting
  those two objects in a common devotion in England, and
  offering myself to promote it. Several things led me to feel
  strongly on the subject which, being trifles to others if not
  to myself, I omit. First, as to the Blessed Eucharist, my
  plan was different from yours in one respect, that, instead of
  fixing on one day, I proposed to engage priests to say mass
  for the conversion of England on different days, so that
  every day twenty or thirty masses might be said for its conversion,
  and in expiation to the Blessed Sacrament. At
  such a distance from the field of action, I could do but little;
  I therefore made the few priests who have left since last
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
  year at this time put down their names for two days a month,
  for mass for these purposes, intending to fill up my list as I
  could. One of them, Mr. Abraham, writes that he observes
  his engagement most punctually. With all deference, I submit
  to you whether, while Thursday remains the day for
  general prayer, every priest (for I should think none would
  refuse) would choose a couple of days a month, or a day each
  week, for these purposes. In a sermon in the Ges e Maria,
  last spring, I alluded to a hope I fondly cherished, that
  public reparation would before long be made in England to
  the Blessed Sacrament, and this brought me a letter from a
  devout lady, earnestly begging I would try to have something
  done in that way, and naming persons in England
  most anxious to cooperate in anything of the sort. My idea
  was borrowed from my excellent friend, Charles Weld, and
  consisted in <i>Quarant' Ore</i>, not confined to one town, but
  making the circuit of all England, so that by day and night
  the Adorable Sacrament might be worshipped through the
  year. I have proposed it to Lord Shrewsbury, for I think
  it should commence with the colleges, convents, gentlemen's
  chapels, and large towns, in which I trust each chapel would
  consent. As the Exposition at each place lasts two days, it
  would require 182 changes in the year, or, if each would
  take it twice a year, 91. There are about twenty-five
  religious communities and colleges; the chapels in large towns
  could afford to make up other twenty-five. I think that
  many pious people would like to have the <i>Exposition</i>, and
  gladly contribute the expense, and the <i>giro</i> might be published
  for the year in each directory. I must say I should
  set myself against the common practice of keeping the
  Blessed Sacrament in a <i>cupboard</i> in the vestry, without a
  light even, and never having an act of adoration paid to it,
  except at mass. Security from sacrilege must be purchased,
  but not by a sort of sacrilege which it always looked to me;
  the faithful should be encouraged to visit the Blessed Sacrament
  during the day. Secondly, as to the devotion to the
  Blessed Virgin, I proposed the forming of Confraternities
  of the Rosary, and, while Saturday should be the general
  day for the devotion, I would have different congregations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
  fix on different days, so that each day the powerful intercession
  of the Blessed Virgin might be invoked upon us and
  upon our labours, and reparation be made to her for the outrages
  committed against her. I offered Mr. Oxley and Mr.
  Procter to write a little treatise on the Rosary, if they
  would disseminate it. <i>One</i> of my reasons for preferring the
  Rosary, both for myself and English Catholics, is what ordinarily
  forms an objection to it. Pride, when we come to
  pray, is our most dangerous enemy, and I think no better
  security can be given against it than to pray as the poor and
  ignorant do. Do we then <i>wish</i> that God should judge us by
  the standard of the wise who <i>know</i> their duty, or by that of
  the poor little ones? If by the latter, why spurn the
  prayers instituted for them, and say, 'We will not use them,
  but the prayers better suited to the learned.' The 'Our
  Father' was appointed and drawn up for men who said
  'Lord, teach us how to pray.' It is a prayer for the ignorant,
  as is the Rosary. But more of this another time. It was
  my intention to have begun daily prayers for England last
  St. George's Day; I was prevented from drawing them up,
  but hope to begin this year. In the meantime, I took out
  of our archives a printed paper, of which I enclose a copy,
  showing that prayers for the conversion of England, &amp;c.,
  have in former times occupied the attention of our college,
  which blessed beads, &amp;c., for the purpose of encouraging
  them, and that the Holy See conferred ample spiritual privileges
  upon the practice. You will see how the Rosary is
  particularly privileged. This paper, through Giustiniani, I
  laid before the Congregation of Indulgences to get them renewed
  for prayers for England, and was told that it would
  be better to draw up something new, suited to present times,
  when Indulgences would be granted. So far as to my views
  and ideas before your better ones reached me, and I willingly
  resign all my views and intentions in favour of yours. Now,
  as to what is doing here. On the Feast of St. Thomas we
  distributed to all the cardinals that came, a copy of your
  sermon received that morning, with a beautiful lithograph
  of St. Thomas, Cant., executed in the house at some
  of the students' expense, to propagate devotion to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
  Cardinal Orioli declared that he had for years made a
  <i>memento</i> for England in his mass, and Cardinal Giustiniani
  told me the other day that every Thursday he offers up mass
  for its conversion. There is a little religious weekly journal
  published here for distribution among the poor, and it has
  lately been in almost every number soliciting prayers for
  the same purpose. Its principal editor, an ex-Jesuit, Padre
  Basiaco, called on me the other evening, and told me, as a
  singular coincidence, that since he was in his noviciate he
  has made it a practice to pray on Thursday for that object.
  To show you to what an extent the pious custom is spreading,
  the Austrian Ambassador the other evening told me that his
  little boys (about seven and eight years old) prayed every
  Thursday morning for the conversion of England; and that
  having been asked by their mother on that day if he had
  prayed for it, one of the little fellows replied, 'No, mamma;
  it is not Thursday.' Surely God must intend to grant a
  mercy when He stirs up so many to pray for it, and that,
  too, persons having no connection with the object, except by
  zeal or charity. I am going, in a day or two, to concert
  with Pallotta the best means of propagating this devotion,
  both in communities and among the people. I perfectly
  approve of enlarging your original plan so as to embrace all
  that are in error. I am in favour of giving expansion to
  charities in any way, and <i>Catholicising</i> our feelings as much
  as our faith. We are too insular in England in religion as
  in social ideas. This was one of my reasons for wishing to
  have the <i>oeuvre</i> unconnected with domestic purposes, which
  would, however, be benefited by the greater energy which
  the spirit of charity would receive by being extended. I
  am endeavouring to excite in the students as much as I can
  the missionary spirit; all the meditations are directed to
  this. By the missionary spirit I do not mean merely a
  parochial, but an apostolic spirit, where each one, besides
  his own especial flock, takes an interest in, and exerts himself
  for the benefit of the entire country, according to the
  gifts he has received. Remember me in your prayers, and
  believe me your sincere and affectionate friend,
<br><br>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br>
His Last Days In West Bromwich.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The account given of Father Spencer's zealous labours for
the conversion of England would be incomplete if something
were not added to show how he succeeded in bringing
persons into the Church in the locality of which he had the
spiritual charge. There is no record of the number he received,
and only from stray notes, from various sources,
can some instances of his way of working be given. He
was not a great preacher, as all knew; but there was a peculiar
spirit in what he said which seemed to impress his discourse
upon the hearer as if it came not from himself. This
want of human eloquence was a drawback to him inasmuch
as it was not likely to bring crowds to hear him. An anecdote
or two will illustrate this. Once he was asked to preach
in Manchester, and many Catholics who heard of it went, of
course, to hear the convert who was talked and written
about so much. Among the rest, one young man who had
beforehand built castles in his own mind about the glowing
eloquence he should hear. To his disappointment, the
preacher was cold, dry, and tame. He was not too pleased,
but some way or another every word took effect upon him,
and he could not quit thinking of the sermon, and the peculiar
way in which many things were said. The end of it
was, that he became, some time after, a Passionist, and was
one of those in whom Father Ignatius found great consolation,
on account of the zeal he showed and continues still to
show, in the pursuit of the darling objects of Father Ignatius's
life. A lady was more pointed in her remarks. She
went to hear him on some other great occasion, and she
said:&mdash;"I saw him go into the pulpit; I heard him address
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
the people, and I was waiting all the time thinking when will
he have done talking and begin to preach, until, to my surprise,
I found what purported to be a sermon coming to a
conclusion, yet I can remember to this day almost everything
he said."
</p>
<p>
From the little weight Father Spencer laid upon human
learning in the work of conversion, one would be tempted
to suppose he undervalued what he did not possess. No
greater mistake could be made. He was a Cambridge first-class
man, and must therefore be a good mathematical and
classical scholar. He spoke Italian and French almost
without a grammatical fault, and conversed very well in
German. He was well read in the English Protestant
divines, and knew Catholic theology with accuracy, and to
an extent which his academical course would not lead us to
expect. It may be said that his youth and manhood were
spent over the pages of the best English writers, and in the
company often of the best living authors. Althorp and
Spencer House were famous for their literary coteries, and
the son of an earl who patronized men of talent, and gave
unmistakable proofs of great talent himself, was not one to
let such opportunities pass without profit.
</p>
<p>
He trusted little, however, to the sway of intellect, and
put his hope in fervent petitions for divine grace. He told
Dr. Wiseman that he should apply his mind to something
more practical than Syriac manuscripts, or treatises on
geology, and that he would rather see him taken up with
what suited a priest on the English mission as it then was.
The rector, of course, took the rebuke as humility dictated;
but we should certainly be sorry that he had not written his
<i>Connexion between Science and Revealed Religion</i>, and his
<i>Lectures on the Eucharist</i>. Spencer, to be sure, was mistaken
in this; but the idea gave a bent to his mind, which he
could hardly be expected to change when hampered with
the work of a parish.
</p>
<p>
They who knew him well can give testimony to his high
attainments, and all who ever heard him speak of himself
can bear a more ample testimony still to the very low opinion
he had of his own acquirements. It is no wonder that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
wrote no books; the little he did publish in the way of
newspaper letters and sermons during his last years in West
Bromwich, did not produce much apparent effect. It is
not our province to review these here, but it is well to say
that the sermons rank far above his spoken ones in point of
style and matter, especially the French sermon he preached
in Dieppe in 1838.
</p>
<p>
The prayers, to which he chiefly trusted for the conversion
of his countrymen, did not bring much evident gain. Others
reaped what he sowed in this way, and he tells us in the
Dieppe sermon that during a confirmation Dr. Walsh gave
in that year he had 600 new converts to impose hands
upon.
</p>
<p>
His field at this time was confined mostly to his conversation
and example; to both of which his name and reputation
added something in the eyes of the world. These gave
him leave to speak at least, and procured him listeners where
other priests would not obtain a hearing. And he had no
small power in word and example, as all who knew him are
aware, and a few incidents may serve to illustrate.
</p>
<p>
As to his conversation, its peculiar charm consisted in the
importance of its drift, and the nice sweet humour by which
he rendered it agreeable. Besides, it may be safely said,
that there scarcely ever was a man so happy in his illustrations,
or in the homely way in which he put an argument,
or answered an objection. This last property can be seen
from the following passage, which is quoted from one of his
letters to a newspaper:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I was once attacked by a stanch
  Church of England man, who had been an old sailor, and
  had lost an arm in the service, for what he thought was unworthy
  of my character and family, leaving my colours and
  changing sides. I answered him thus: Suppose you, my
  friend, had entered a ship bearing the King of England's
  flag and pennant, and gone out and fought many a battle
  against French cruisers, but then found out by chance that
  the captain of the ship was an outlawed pirate, who had no
  right to the colours which he wore, and was making you
  fight for himself, not for your king, would you let me call
  you a deserter if the next time you came within hail of a
 <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
  true king's ship you jumped overboard and swam to her?
  The good sailor seemed to understand me, and said no more
  about leaving my colours."
</p>
<p>
It was remarked that very few ever went to speak with
him in earnest about their soul with any kind of docility,
whom he did not succeed in bringing into the Church. Then
his example was a continual sermon. He preferred the poor,
not as poor wretches on whom he thought it was heroic to
spend a few kind words of mawkish pity, but, in order to
make them feel as if they were his brothers and sisters. He
would come into their hovels, sit down with them, and even
take a cup of tea there, which he might have refused at a
richer place. They represented to him the person of Jesus
Christ, who said, "The poor you have always with you," as
a substitute for Himself.
</p>
<p>
His patience was no less wonderful. One day he was
walking with a sort of bag on his shoulder, when an insolent
fellow came out before him and spat in his face. His
housekeeper was with him, helping to carry some articles,
for he was then going to say mass in one of the little places
he had opened near Bromwich. She of course fired with
indignation at once, and said: "You wicked man! how dare
you spit in the face of Lord Spencer's son, and he such a
good gentleman? "Mr. Spencer took out his handkerchief,
wiped his face, and only said to the housekeeper: "And
how dare you be angry? I am proud of being treated as
my dear Lord was;" and went on his way as if nothing had
happened. He did not even allude to it again.
</p>
<p>
He was also very abstemious, and never took wine or
spirits for a number of years; indeed, he may be said to
have tasted none except as medicine since he became a
Catholic, and for sometime before. His bishop told a very
curious anecdote about this. Father Spencer took very
little sleep, and in fact he so shortened his time of rest that
often, when returning home from a sick call, he would be
nodding asleep up the street, and walk like a man who had
taken "a little more than was good for him." He was reported
to the bishop as being seen in this state. The bishop
was amused first, and then surprised; but when he found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
out the cause, notwithstanding that he was edified, he made
the good priest sleep a little longer every night. This only
shows how captious were the people he had to deal with,
and how easily they might have been scandalized. Yet he
was venerated by all Catholics as a saint, and Protestants
began to respect him after some time as a really good man,
and a server of the Lord according to his conscience. The
opinion of his sanctity was not merely superficial hearsay;
his brother priests, who knew him most intimately, and
were not the persons to take the appearance of holiness for
the reality, are all of one opinion, that his life was the life
of a great saint. A student writes to Father Spencer's
assistant, Rev. Mr. Elves, in 1838, from Rome, in the following
terms:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It must be a very great source of edification
  to you to be the companion of Mr. Spencer, and I well
  know he has got in you a friend willing and ready to imitate
  his holy example. I am sorry that illness obliges him to
  retire from you for the present, but it will be a consolation
  for you to think that he has gone to gather more strength
  for the contest. Many a time I have dwelt with delight on
  the idea of being at some future period his fellow missioner,
  for I feel it would be a source of zeal and fervour to me to
  live with such a person, and I hope and pray God my
  wishes may be fulfilled, and that I may have such a companion,
  or rather such a director, during the first years of
  my missionary career."
</p>
<p>
This letter must have been an
answer to the account the priest sent his young friend of the
holiness of his companion.
</p>
<p>
Again, Father Spencer never heeded what we call the
public, as he said himself he wished to ignore its existence;
and strange enough by that very means he gained its
esteem. This is best illustrated by what happened on his
return from France, in '38. He saw the clergy there of
course go about in their soutanes and full ecclesiastical
costume; and he did not see why he might not do the same.
He ignored the public, put on his cassock, and went in full
priestly costume everywhere. He went to towns, into trains
and omnibuses, walks the streets, and he gives the result in
a letter to a friend thus: "This has not procured me one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
disrespectful word, which is worthy of remark here, for I do
not think I ever passed two or three weeks in this place
without being hooted after by boys or men somewhere."
</p>
<p>
Thus we have the servant following his Master, drinking
in insults as sweet draughts in silence and humility; and
when he was supposed to be ground to the very earth by
ignominy, gaining a respect, a love, and a reputation that is
as fresh to-day in his old parish among not only those who
knew him but their children who heard of him. Yes, this
day, more than 25 years in distance of time, he is, if possible,
more venerated and more regretted than the day he resigned
the pastoral charge of West Bromwich.
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br>
Father Spencer Comes To Oscott.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The Bishop, Dr. Walsh, calls Mr. Spencer to Oscott College
towards the end of April or perhaps in the beginning
of May, 1839. The object of this change was, to give him
the spiritual care of the students, in order that he might
shape their characters, and infuse into them that apostolic
spirit of which he had already given such proofs. Here is
one other instance of the true way to real distinction in
greatness in the Catholic Church, lying through the road
humility and its concomitant virtues points out. Father
Spencer sought to be unknown; he petitioned for the
poorest and the most unprovided mission. In his little
parish he found his earthly paradise, and the toils and
troubles he went through, to make his practice keep pace
with his fervour, formed the links of his happiness. He
prayed, he lectured, he heard confessions; he sought the
stragglers in their haunts of idleness; he had no idea of
extending his sphere of action beyond the limits of his
mission, and, he even made the half of that over to
another, that his working could be the more effectual as its
space was narrowed. Every plan he devised for doing good
on a large scale was fated to become abortive. His natural
means of influence he had cast aside; he gave up writing in
newspapers, and let dogs bark at him without stooping to
notice them; his high connections were virtually sundered
when he gave up paying visits to his family; his property he
divested himself of altogether, and grieved that the steward
who was appointed to look after him took too much care of
him, and did not let him feel what it was to be poor indeed.
Here then is the young nobleman transformed into the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
priest, and stripped of everything, which priests who were
not noble often pursue as necessary for their position; ay,
thoroughly shorn to the bare condition of a priest. He
was a priest and nothing more, and that is saying a great
deal. If priests were always mere priests they would
always be great saints. But when a priest dips his sacred
character into worldly pursuits, riches, human aims and
ways; when that sublime dignity he has received is trampled
upon by his own self, and is saturated in the deep dye of
worldliness, he ceases to be great, inasmuch as he ceases to
be a priest in sentiment and action. It is often supposed
that a priest has to do many things in consideration of "his
cloth." Many actions that humility dictates are considered
<i>infra dig</i>. It would be so, for instance, to carry one's own
bundle, polish one's shoes, allow a navvy to spit in one's face,
or a ragamuffin to tear one's coat, without handing him
over to the police. St. Francis Xavier did not think it
<i>infra dig</i> to wash his own shirt, and Father Spencer was
very much of that saint's way of thinking on this and
kindred points.
</p>
<p>
When, however, he had arrived at the lowest depth of
humiliation he could possibly reach, like his Divine Master,
he began to shine forth and to move the whole world. We
have traced above how this change came about. He used to
speak to every one, merely as agreeable matter of hopeful
conversation, about the conversion of England, and get
them also to pray for it. His crusade was quite accidental
as far as his own preconceived notions were concerned. He
went to France with Mr. Phillipps, much against his will,
and found himself all of a sudden launched into the great
work of his life, by the encouraging words of French
prelates. He was not the man to lose an opportunity of
doing good through lack of energy or fear of opposition.
He could brave everything for God's glory. If there was
anything that helped him best in his work, it was the opposition
he encountered. He knew that, and therefore every
new stroke levelled against him from friends or foes was a
fresh impetus to new exertions. Hence he is now the correspondent
of the heads of the Catholic Church at home
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
and on the continent; all the religious orders have heard of
him and his zeal for England; seculars have heard; priests,
nuns, monks, all chime in with his notions; many because
they were glad to have the opportunity, many because they
did not wish to be behind their neighbours, and all because
it was a good, holy, and laudable thing to pray for the
conversion of heretics.
</p>
<p>
He says little about his property or what is being done
with it in any of the letters that remain after him; but a
bishop in whose diocese he lived has told us something. Mr.
Spencer had from his father's will and testament 3,600 in
some funds, besides an annuity of 300 for life, to which
300 were added <i>ad beneplacitum dantis</i>. His moderate
way of living took very little from this sum every year, so
all the remainder, with the interest of some years, was at
the bishop's disposal. Two missions, Dudley and West
Bromwich, were founded by him with this property, at least
for the greater part; and the ground upon which the present
college of Oscott stands was bought chiefly with what
Father Spencer gave the bishop. He gave a pension to his
old housekeeper, which she still receives, and whilst his
property was thus doing good for others and the Church, he
would not travel in a first-class carriage on the railway, and
often walked from Oscott to Birmingham, in order to be
able to give the fare for his journey to some persons along
the way.
</p>
<p>
He had done more than this: he was in close correspondence
with Dr. Gentili and Father Dominic. He paved
their way, and worked upon the opinions of many whose
influence was required for their introduction into England.
Dr. Gentili was a personal friend of his, and so was Father
Dominic; but Father Spencer thought the claims of the
former somewhat stronger for reasons which can only be
surmised. Mrs. Gaming, his cousin, to whose letters we
owe a great deal of the information we are able to glean
concerning their transactions, was the great advocate of the
Passsionists. She so pressed the matter upon him that he
gets rather impatient, and tells her to mind her prayers and
leave these things to others. Our Fathers agreed in General
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
Chapter, in 1839, to send a colony to England; but as there
was no provision made nor opening offered, for some years
more this decision, was not carried into effect. The
Passionists refer their coming to England, under God, to
Cardinal Wiseman, acknowledging at the same time that
Father Spencer did something towards the work. He also
had a good deal to do with the coming of the Trappists to
Loughborough, near Mr. Phillipps's. In all these three
events he works in his own quiet way, beneath the surface,
writing and advising, and doing what lay in his power
consistent with other duties.
</p>
<p>
He keeps up correspondence by letter with some of his
old friends at college, and with one or two of the Tractarians,
Mr. Palmer, the author of the "Church of Christ," among
the number. An old friend of his writes to him from among
the Irvingites, and Father Spencer writes to another in
these terms:&mdash;"The supposed miraculous voice, to which
that party (the Irvingites) attend, has named 12 men as
Apostles, who expect shortly to be endued with miraculous
powers to enable them to restore the Church in its perfect
beauty. Drummond the banker is one. Spencer Percival,
and my great friend Henry Bridgman, Lord Bradford's
brother, others." It is not a little strange that this Mr.
Bridgman comes into the journal of Father Ignatius's Cambridge
life very frequently, and mostly in the character of a
Mentor.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius never gained much from correspondence,
sought on his part, with leading men in the great religious
movements of the period. But whenever others sought his
advice, they generally became Catholics. They were disposed
for truth, and he could remove objections, tell them of
books, and pray for them. He broke off this kind of unasked-for
correspondence at this time, but he resumed it
again on a different footing, as shall be related in its place.
</p>
<p>
He had another means of doing good now, which could
not come into his line while simple pastor of a country
district. The college of Oscott was a place worth seeing, if
not as a specimen of architecture, at least as being the
stronghold of Catholicism, and the centre of a great deal of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
intellectual and moral training. Many of his great friends,
who could not hitherto devise any plausible plea for visiting
him in his retirement, could find one immediately now, from
the place he dwelt in as well as the position he there held.
His name was also noised abroad, and persons would feel
some curiosity for the acquaintance of one who was moving
heaven and earth for their conversion. Accordingly, we find
that he entertains his two brothers, the then earl and his
successor, on one day; Lord Lyttelton and Mr. Gladstone
on another day, and so forth. Thus, that particular power
he possessed in his conversation had a field upon which it
could be brought into requisition, in a manner which former
arrangements had debarred to him.
</p>
<p>
Several of the sermons he preached were published and
distributed. There was no faculty of his, natural or supernatural,
no good deed he was capable of doing, that did not
come into play far better by his late transfer to Oscott. He
was also practised in the drudgery of a missionary priest&mdash;
that sphere of action which fills up a priest's ordinary life;
and he was able from experience to teach others, not only
how to prepare themselves, but how to succeed with profit
to themselves and others in this work. He had also peculiar
advantages here; he could give the young ecclesiastics
not only the abstract rules for missionary labour, but a taste
and relish for it, for very seldom can one succeed well if his
tastes run counter to his duties. He did this by continuing
in Oscott his old parish work; he visited the sick, brought
them the sacraments; he gave a portion of every day to his
favourite work, and by the incidents he came across, and the
results of his labours, he raised up the young gentlemen's
notions to the looking upon that as the poetic side of their
ministry which is generally supposed to be the most prosaic.
This is a great secret in the training of young men; to tell
them best is best, and prove it to them, will convince them
of course; but it will not lead them; there must be some
grace, some romantic aspect put upon the thing, and then it
entices them of itself. This was Father Spencer's secret,
and, indeed, it might be said that it was his rule. He writes
in a letter now, that he condemns asperity in controversy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
and that civility and good breeding, with pity and love, is
the way to confound opponents; and that he would rather
see a clever argument unanswered than met with pungency
and acrimony. This might be quarrelled with, for in war
all things are lawful; but the real state of opinion to which
he came on these matters was, that opponents were surer to
be conquered by being enticed than driven. Let the Catholic
religion but be seen in its native beauty, and thousands
will be led to examine it.

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br>
Some Of His Doings In Oscott College.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Father Spencer's way of training young men has been
already hinted at. He carried it out while he remained in
his new office; he would go heartily into all their sports,
make up their matches for cricket, and even give the
younger ones instructions in the art. They had all a high
opinion of his sanctity, and therefore the keeping of their
juvenile spirits in order was not always a difficult matter.
Oscott contained at the time 140 students, 30 only of whom
were ecclesiastics. Among the lay students, who are mostly
younger than the others, and have a notion too that because
they do not intend to be priests they are not obliged to be
so guarded as the rest, there were several who were not very
manageable. One day a class he had in hand were rather
uproarious; he quietly advised them to come to better sentiments;
his words were, however, lost, and the noise was not
abated. He remonstrated again, but all to no purpose. At
length he got a hearing, and said: "Since I cannot correct
you, and do not wish to chastise you, I shall pray to God
to chastise you Himself." This, said in his sad mood, had
such an effect upon the boys that it was never forgotten,
and he never had the least difficulty with his class again.
</p>
<p>
On another occasion he did something in execution of his
duty, which gave great offence to one of the young men.
This young man grossly insulted him, in words that shocked
all who were within hearing, and particularly reflected on
the Father's character as a gentleman and a man of honour.
The insult must have been the more galling as the person
who was guilty of it was by birth and education in the
position of a gentleman. One calm and placid look was the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
only answer from Father Spencer, which reminded many
present of our Lord's look at Peter after his denial. For
this anecdote and the next we are indebted to the Right
Rev. Dr. Amherst.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "When he (Father Spencer) was a superior at Oscott, I
  had the good fortune to be under him. He frequently
  visited me and several of my companions in our rooms,
  where he would talk with greatest earnestness of the conversion
  of England, of the sanctification of the priesthood, and
  of the entire devotedness which should characterize a priest.
  Sometimes his visits took place late at night after we were
  gone to bed, when, if we were not asleep, he would sit upon
  a chair, a table, or the edge of the bed, and speak of his
  favourite themes for an hour. Once I remember awaking
  in the morning, after one of these visits, and expecting to
  find the father still seated on my bed, not perceiving that
  the night had passed. He had, no doubt, found that I had
  gone asleep, and went away quietly."
</p>
<p>
Another time one of the students, a young man about
17, who is now a zealous priest in the English Mission,
happened to be out shooting somewhere. He took a shot at
a blackbird, and some poor old woman was within range,
and received a shot just over the eye. She cried out that
she was shot, and one may imagine the embarrassment of
the young student. She recovered, however; but in a year
or two after the occurrence, a quack doctor applied some
remedies to a new swelling in the eye, and swelling and
remedies resulted in her death. There was an inquest held
in Birmingham, to which the student was summoned.
Whilst awaiting the day, the poor fellow was in very low
spirits, as might be expected. Father Spencer went to his
room to console him, and said that he had no reason to be
cast down, that it was quite accidental, and permitted by
God as a trial, with a great deal more. It was of little use,
the poor student said, "but they might transport me."
"Beautiful, beautiful," exclaimed the good Father; "fine
field for the exercise of apostolic zeal among the poor convicts."
"But then they might even hang me," rejoined the
student. "Glorious sacrifice," said Father Spencer; "you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
can offer your life, though innocent in this case, in satisfaction
for your other sins." Well, the student, though he
thought the sentiments very high for his grade of spirituality,
did not fail to profit by them, and tells the story to
this day with a great deal of interest. Thus did Father
Spencer work among the students, a model in all virtues,
and so sweet and holy in his manner that his words went
to the very heart with effect.
</p>
<p>
This was how he went on in the ordinary routine of the
work allotted to him; but his zeal could not be bounded by
such a sphere, he had tried what expansion could do, and
he sought by grand schemes to get other ways of doing
good. His great notion was "perfection for all." "Be ye
perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect," was ever ringing
in <i>his</i> ears, and he desired to see that great counsel of
our Divine Lord acted upon with more earnestness. He
would do his share; he had long been living like a religious,
and practising the three evangelical counsels with success.
He wanted now to extend the same rule to others. Of
course, he did not find many to adopt his notions, but lest
priests might be considered to assume too much in condemning
his plans, he was advised to put his ideas on paper, and
send them to Rome. He did so, and the answer of the
Roman Censor was unfavourable. This was a heavy blow,
but he submitted at once, and thanked God he had superiors
who could find out his faults, and knew how to correct him
without human respect. We have reason to suppose this
censor was no other than Dr. Wiseman, for he and Father
Spencer differed a little about the introduction of religious
orders into England. Father Spencer said his hope was
not in religious orders, but in secular priests living the lives
of religious. This was why he took no leading part in
bringing Passionists or others into his country; he had a
great opinion of their holiness, and wished to see them
working for the conversion of England, but rather at a
distance than in the field.
</p>
<p>
To add to his crosses, Dr. Baines published a pastoral
towards the end of the year 1839, in which he gave no
hopes of the conversion of England, and prohibited public
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
prayers being made for that end. This was a terrible blow
to poor Father Spencer; he wrote as if he did not well
understand what he had to say, and the thing looked to
him so uncalled-for and so uncharitable, that he was unable
to explain himself. He was, however, pleased to find out
afterwards that this very opposition gave new strength to
the cause.
</p>
<p>
In a sermon which Father Spencer preached in Manchester,
in May, 1839, he used some expressions that gave
offence to Catholic principles. The drift of the discourse is
that Catholics and Protestants should sacrifice everything
except truth itself for peace sake. In bringing this principle
into application, he says the Catholics should offer
themselves open to conviction, and be ready to lay down
their belief, if it could be proved not true. He uses the
following words:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The truth of my faith as a Christian
  and a Catholic is, to my mind, a certainty, because I have
  evidence that it was taught by God, who cannot deceive
  nor be deceived. Will that evidence be weakened by fresh
  examination and discussion? and do I anyways make an
  unholy or a perilous concession, when I declare myself
  ready to renounce my belief, if it were sufficiently shown to
  me that the evidences on which I believe it to be divine
  are wrong? I embraced and hold it now, because the
  evidence of its truth, was, and is to my mind unanswerable.
  I show no doubting of its truth, but, on the contrary, I
  declare how little doubt I have of its truth, when I profess
  myself with all my heart willing to renounce it if proved
  not true, and to embrace any form of doctrine which shall
  be presented in its place on sufficient grounds of credibility.
  This is the spirit in which I wish all Catholics would offer
  themselves to discussion with our Protestant brethren."
</p>
<p>
If he meant this as a bold assertion of the certainty with
which he held the Catholic faith, and would offer these
terms because convinced of the utter impossibility of proving
him to be wrong, it might be barely tolerated. It is a
form of speech that has sometimes been used by controversialists&mdash;
Maguire, for instance&mdash;but it has none the less been
always considered rash. That this was the sense in which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
Father Spencer used it, is abundantly evident from other parts
of the sermon. However, the proposition that a Catholic
and a Protestant may meet on equal terms to discuss their
tenets, each open to conviction by the other's arguments, is
simply erroneous and scandalous, to say nothing more. We
cannot do such a thing without denying the very basis of
our faith. Our faith is not opinion, nor is it certainty
simply. It is something more. It is a divine virtue infused
into our souls, whereby we believe certain things.
We must use reason to come to the evidence of faith, but
faith once obtained must never be left at the mercy of the
fickleness and weakness of any individual's understanding
or power of argument.
</p>
<p>
To lay down the proposition we animadvert on, would be
equivalent to denying the objectivity of faith altogether.
Whether a Catholic reasons well or ill, answers arguments
or is confounded, his faith is the same; it is not his faith
simply, but the faith of the Catholic Church, the faith
given by God, which no man can add to or take from. Nay,
the very putting of oneself in the position here mentioned
is a real tempting God, if not undermining faith itself, by
laying it open to the possibility of doubt. There is no use
in deceiving Protestants, therefore, by apparent concessions
like the rash offer which we said might be tolerated. It is
impossible; our terms are fixed, and we are fixed in them,
so that it is merely an exaggeration, in its mildest form.
When, therefore, Father Spencer lays it down thus, and
says that it is the spirit in which he would wish all Catholics
to discuss, he may be fairly taxed with the second
interpretation. Whether or no, it was wrong to preach it to
all Catholics. Fancy a poor woman, who could scarcely read,
entering into a discussion with an educated Protestant on
these terms. He was of course called to order for this
sermon, but his Catholic spirit was his safeguard. He first
wondered how he had been wrong, but even laymen point
out his mistake to him, and a word from the Bishop is
enough to make him retract. Thus he soon found out the
keenness of Catholic instinct to anything coming from a
priest that even grazes the brink of error.
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
<br>


<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br>
Some Events Of Interest.</h2>
<br>
<p>
In the year 1840 Father Spencer had the happiness of hearing
that his great friend, Dr. Wiseman, was consecrated
bishop, and was coming from Rome to be coadjutor to Dr.
Walsh, and take up his residence in the very College of
Oscott where he himself was. Another event occurred, of
no less interest. One of his brother priests, Dr. Wareing,
was consecrated Bishop of Ariopolis, and Vicar-Apostolic
of a new district, the Eastern district in England. Father
Spencer preached the consecration sermon; and these two
additional bishops in England raised his hopes of the spread
of the Catholic faith. It may not be out of place to insert
a sentence or two from a letter this venerable bishop, who
has retired from his pastoral duties in consequence of ill
health for some time past, has written to one of our fathers.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "On many occasions, while at Oscott College, the Superior,
  and myself among the rest, often thought his zeal too unbounded
  and rather imprudent, and could not sanction some
  of his projects and undertakings. Though it cost him much,
  he always obeyed, and used to pray that Heaven would direct
  his superiors, whose direction he never refused to obey. I
  believe he never wished for anything but the will of God,
  and waited patiently for its accomplishment. I remember
  also on one occasion hearing him say, 'How <i>beautiful</i> it
  would be <i>to die in a ditch, unseen and unknown</i>.'
  [Footnote 9] These
  were his very words; and I was forcibly struck when I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
  heard of the exact circumstances of his holy death, to see
  how his wish and prayer were granted to him."
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 9:
  This was his continual aspiration. He wished to die like his
  Lord, deprived of human aid and sympathy.]
</p>
<p>
He receives news in the beginning of the year 1841 of
six nuns having bound themselves by vow to pray for the
conversion of England. But a more beautiful and consolatory
piece of information still was, that a French missioner
had formed an association in Persia of prayers for the same
object. He goes to London and preaches in several churches,
among others, in Lincoln's-Inn Fields, of course about the
conversion of England, for he scarcely ever preached a
sermon in which he did not introduce this topic; nay, he
never held a half-hour's conversation without introducing
it.
</p>
<p>
It was about this time, too, that he came across Mr.
Pugin the elder. His first meeting was rather characteristic
of both. Father Spencer had preached a sermon somewhere
on the conversion of England, and he gave benediction after
it. Pugin came into the sacristy. The famous Goth saw
Father Spencer in a Roman cope, and he comes up to him
in a kind of nettlesome mood, saying, "What! convert
England with such a cope as that?" Father Spencer says
in a letter written at this time, "I am not possessed with
the enthusiastic zeal for correct forms (Gothic) which some
are. It is not my special calling .... Mr. Pugin
is the authority to which I would defer in these matters."
The only other opinion of Pugin's he records in his letters,
is that he said to Father Spencer one time, "It is absurd to
expect to get anything for one's works from booksellers or
publishers."
</p>
<p>
Another event that gave him joy, and afterwards a good
deal of sorrow, was the conversion of a well-known, clergyman.
This remarkable convert lived some time in Oscott
after his conversion. Father Spencer took him with him
sometimes on his parish duties, and had great hopes of him.
These were all disappointed when, in a couple of years, he
went back again after being ordained priest and having said
mass. Father Ignatius often spoke of him, often visited
him, and asked others to pray for him. He used to tell us
one curious anecdote about him. Shortly after his apostasy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
he was invited to a tea-party where Evangelical ladies
assembled to congratulate themselves, and sip their tea with
new relish by having it sugared with some telling remarks of
the lately-rescued slave from Popery. He was put several
questions, such as "What do you think of Transubstantiation?"
He answered, "Oh, that's as plain as possible in
the Bible," and so forth. They were, of course, egregiously
disappointed. Father Ignatius used to lament with peculiar
anguish over this sad case. He always hoped for his return
to the Catholic faith, and, strange enough, one of the first
pieces of news in the way of conversion which we heard
after Father Ignatius's death, was his return to the faith he
had deserted.
</p>
<p>
In the middle of the year 1842, he visits Ireland for the
first time; he preaches in several places, in Dublin; especially
for the Jesuits, in Gardiner Street; the Franciscans,
Merchant's Quay. All, of course, about the conversion of
England. He says: "My argument was, that the Irish
having been specially victims of oppression under England,
if I could gain the Irish to pray for England, prayers springing
from such charity would be irresistible." He made a
kind of a tour through Ireland, and got as far as Tuam.
He feared the Archbishop of Tuam, knowing his opposition
to England, and his detestation of English rule. For that
very reason Father Spencer was the more anxious to convert
him, or make him return good for evil. What was his
surprise when he found the Archbishop not only kind and
Irish in his hospitality, but really favourable to his projects.
His grace got Father Spencer to preach, and promised him
that he would give the substance of the same sermon to his
people in their own sweet ancient tongue on the next Sunday.
He was so enchanted at this, that he wrote off almost to
every friend he had in the world about it. Though he often
felt afterwards the powerful blows Dr. McHale delivered at
England's doings, he never could forget his kind reception
of himself, and always mentioned his grace's name with
gratitude and reverence, only wishing that he would not be
so hard on England.
</p>
<p>
The next event he writes about was the arrival in England
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
of Father Dominic of the Mother of God (Passionist), and
his staying at Oscott for some time in order to learn English
and wait for an opening in Aston to begin the first retreat
of the English province. Before we quote his account of
Father Dominic, it may be well to give a rather characteristic
remark of his which occurs in the letter to Mrs.
Canning, who was a great promoter, in the letter-writing
way, of Father Dominic's coming. He says, "Your accounts
of yourself are always interesting, as they must be in all
cases where a person knows how to delineate accurately his
own interior; for, in seeing the picture of another well
drawn, we always may discern little touches of our own
portraiture which had before perhaps escaped us, and that
gives all the pleasure of sympathy, which is one of the
realest pleasures."
</p>
<p>
Further on in the same letter he writes:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Padre Domenico has had his cross to bear with us, all
  this time; it is not like what usually makes crosses for
  people. He mourns over having plenty to eat, having
  windows which keep the weather out, having chairs to sit
  <i>on</i>, and tables to sit at, and longs to be in his house, which
  I suppose will not have much of all this to trouble him. I
  have to try to console him now and then, which I do by
  telling him that I never hear of anything brought about in
  our ecclesiastical arrangements without long delay, and yet
  all comes right at last, with patience. I tell him also that
  he must have known enough of the deliberativeness with
  which things of the kind are settled by the known slowness
  of all things at Rome. However, why should you have to
  bear this burden with us? You will, I hope, be consoled
  before long by hearing that they are settled, and going on,
  and have first a chair, then a table, then a kettle, and likely
  to have a smoke-jack, toasting-fork, and such like in due
  course, and, what will be not less interesting in its way,
  having good novices, and plenty of converts."
</p>
<p>
The next thing he speaks about is not one event, but a
series, though all only items in a great result for which he
continually prayed and laboured&mdash;the conversions, which
multiplied every day. In 1843 he says that converts are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
received in Birmingham at the rate of one a day, and many
more elsewhere. He also mentions with great satisfaction
that within the last year, 1842, three Anglican clergymen,
four Oxford students, two countesses, and two earls' daughters
had become converts. Although Father Spencer mentions
these particularly, it is not to undervalue conversions from
an humbler grade of life he does it. The soul of the beggar
is as precious in the eyes of God, <i>apud quern non est acceptatio
personarum</i>, as the soul of the king. Father Spencer
did not undervalue the conversions of the middle and lower
classes on the contrary, he worked hard to get as many as
possible from them. He had always notions of a great move
towards Catholicity, and he thought that if the higher ranks
took the lead in this, the others would follow.
</p>
<p>
In 1844, he mentions his going to Nottingham with a
large party, among whom is Mr. Ward, "one of the most
advanced Oxford clergy. Oh! that he would come a little
further, but at present he seems to have no thoughts of it.
God knows whether he may not soon get a little help onwards.
Make a good prayer for this." Mr. Ward did get
certainly onwards. Here and there we find sighs escape
him about his beloved people of Northampton and Brington.
He did assuredly love his native place intensely, and it must
have been a trial to his feelings that he could do nothing
externally towards alleviating its spiritual destitution.

<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
His Tour On The Continent In 1844.</h2>
<br>
<p>
In 1844 he became so nervous and weak that he was forbidden
exertion of any kind; his ailment is manifest in his
tremulous handwriting. On medical advice, he takes a tour
on the Continent with Mr. and Mrs. Phillipps and their
children. His account of this tour is preserved in a
Journal, and we think it well to give it entire, without any
compression.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  On <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, July 3rd, 1844,</span>
  I set off from Grace
  Dieu Manor for a tour on the Continent with my dear
  friend, Ambrose Phillipps, his wife, his two eldest boys,
  Ambrose and Edward, and John Squires, his servant. He
  took his carriage, in which he and his family sat on the
  railway from Loughborough to London, while I went in a
  second-class carriage. We arrived at the Burlington Hotel,
  and dined about 7 o'clock. Afterwards we went out different
  ways. I called at Dr. Griffiths, but he was not at home.
  I had tea with Dr. Maguire, whom I found at home; we
  had an hour's talk, about the Oxford men principally. Got
  home about 10.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, July 4.&mdash;</span>Went with the Phillippses to Father
  Lythgoe's, in Bolton Street, where I said mass, and breakfasted
  at 10. I went to see Dr. Chambers, in Brook Street,
  being ordered by Dr. Wiseman to consult him as to the
  propriety of taking a long tour, as is proposed by Phillipps.
  Dr. Chambers recognized me at once, as I used in 1824 or
  1825 to follow his visits to the patients in St. George's
  Hospital, with a view to learn medicine. He judged it
  quite necessary that I should have at least three months'
  absence from work, and approved of my travelling with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
  moderate exertion. So I am fixed at last to set off. God
  knows how I shall go through. The present plan is to go
  through Belgium, to Munich, the Tyrol, Venice, Milan,
  Turin, Lyons, Paris, and home; and my purpose is to get
  prayers for England's conversion, and to see men rather than
  places and things. After Dr. Chambers, I went to the
  Bank, to get my letter of credit, then to Buckingham
  Palace, to see my sister. After I had waited a half-hour
  she returned from her drive, and took me to her nursery
  apartments at the top of the house. I had my first glance
  at Prince Albert, going out to ride with Colonel Bouverie.
  From Sarah, I went to Lyttelton's house, 39, Grosvenor
  Place, where I found Caroline Lyttelton was expected home
  in an hour, and so I went on to call on Sisk, who was
  out, and I came back and saw Lyttelton, with whom I went
  in his carriage towards the House of Lords, and was set
  down in St. James's Street. On the table in Grosvenor
  Place I saw what I was 21 years ago, in a miniature
  painted by Ross&mdash;a blooming rosy youth. I did not believe
  it till Caroline told me. I came to dine with Sarah at 8,
  and staid till 10. Our conversation was most interesting,
  about the Queen and the children, and the great people
  from abroad, &amp;c., whom she saw; above all, the Czar and
  the Duke of Wellington. She set me down at our hotel at
  10, after calling at Neville Grenville's, where I saw Lady
  Charlotte and a large family.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, July 5th.&mdash;</span>
  Mass and breakfast as yesterday.
  About 11 started for Dover, in the same order as from
  Loughborough; arrived at 5. I went to call on Mr. Savage,
  the priest, my old companion at Rome. He does not seem
  a movement man. He came to tea with us.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, July 6th.&mdash;</span>
  As the packet was to start at 7, I
  missed saying mass. As it happened, we had to wait on
  board till 9 for the mail. We had intended to cross to
  Ostend, but Phillipps, getting afraid of the long crossing for
  sickness, so we all agreed to prefer the shorter-by-half
  passage to Calais. We had a good passage, but we all were
  miserable; the two boys were very sick. However, as the
  French boatmen assured us, the tread of the dry land of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
  France worked wonders to cure us all. We went to Dessin's
  Hotel. I was full well reminded of September, 1819, my
  first landing in France, and of divers other epochs, Sept.
  1820, Nov. 1820, and Feb. 1830. Before dinner we went
  to the church to give thanks, and commend our future to
  God. I asked <i>le Suisse de l'Eglise</i> (the verger) to pray for
  England. Nothing else done at Calais. We started in the
  afternoon for S. Omer, which we reached late. The country
  we passed was very fertile; for the first time I have seen
  cultivation which struck me as superior to English; the
  state of the people is manifestly more happy and prosperous.
  After tea I went to the Grand Vicaire, M. Dumez, to ask
  leave for mass, &amp;c. I had forgotten to get credentials from
  Dr. Wiseman, and so he hesitated, but gave the <i>celebret</i>. I
  went on, though tired, to M. Durier, Cur de Notre Dame,
  who received me most cordially, and on my stating my
  errand, pressed me to preach at the high mass on the
  morrow. I hesitated, but he came with me to our hotel,
  and Phillipps joined in pressing it, and so I wrote a quarter
  of an hour's worth before going to bed, hoping I was not
  out of rule, but doubting.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, July 7.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at Notre Dame, a fine Gothic
  church; went home to breakfast, and back to high mass at
  9. After the Gospel, M. Durier first read the <i>annonces</i>,
  the Epistle, and the Gospel, and introduced my object to
  the people. Then I went into the pulpit, and made my
  address without any difficulty. He then rose opposite to
  me, and pledged himself and his flock to pray for England.
  After mass, I went a round of the convents of the town
  with an old man sent from one of them with me. The
  convents which promised their prayers were the following:
</p>
<p class="cite2">
    Les Ursulines, 37 nuns; 300 scholars.
<br><br>
    Les Soeurs Hospitalires de S. Louis.
<br><br>
    L'Hospice de S. Jean, served by nuns.
<br><br>
    L'Hpital Gnral des enfants trouvs, &amp;c.
<br><br>
    Les Religieuses de la Sainte famille.
<br><br>
    Le Couvent du Saint Sacrement,<br>

  "We proceeded at 3 to Lille, stopping at the exit from
  St. Omer to see the ruined Abbaye de St. Bertin. We
  stopped at Cussel, a place on the top of a mountain commanding
  a grand prospect over a vast plain richly wooded
  and cultivated. The matre d'htel wanted us sadly to stay,
  but we went on, after a walk to the top of the mount, and
  to the church. We came late to Lille, and not finding room
  at l'Htel de l'Europe, we put up at l'Htel de Gand, not
  a very nice one, in the Grande Place.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, July 8.&mdash;</span>
  I first went to the Church of St.
  Catherine, to see Abbe Bernard, my friend, introduced
  by Mrs. Canning. He was gone, yesterday, to Paris. I
  then went to Rue Royale, No. 61, memorable for ever as
  the direction to which my letters from Brington to Miss
  Dolling were addressed. M. Friot Chombard, who lives
  there, was also absent from Lille. I then went to the
  Church of St. tienne, where the Grand Doyen lived; and,
  having seen him, I said mass. I then called on him in his
  house, and obtained his promise to advocate the cause of
  England. After breakfast, I went to the Church of St.
  Maurice, which is called the Cathedral. It is the first I
  have seen with four aisles. I saw nothing more in Lille;
  we left it about 12, and reached Tournay about 2. I
  went at once to the vch, where I found the Bishop's
  Secretary, who took me to a great convent of nuns, which
  the Bishop has founded, and is building this house for. It
  is to contain sixty nuns, and a great number of <i>pensionnaires</i>.
  I was presented to his lordship in the garden, and obtained
  a full promise of his patronage of the cause of England. I
  came back to dine at the Hotel (du Singe d'Or); to my surprise
  and pleasure, Talbot came in with Phillipps, who had
  met him in the Cathedral. After dinner, he and I took a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
  carriage and went to see the Passionists au Chteau d'Ere,
  about three miles off. Le Pre Pierre, Superior of the
  house, received us with all kindness. He has three companions
  priests, and three brothers. They were building a
  church of good size, and seem to prosper; but he complains
  that no postulants come; they have received not one cleric
  yet. He thinks they fear the bare feet. He came back
  with us to Tournay, to see Phillipps. Soon after, we started
  on our way to Brussels; still by post horses, as all the way
  from Calais. We stopped at Alte to sleep. The hotel was
  one of the most agreeable and cheapest, though small.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, July 9.&mdash;</span>
  There are two churches at Alte. I
  went to St. Julien's, and said mass. Afterwards I introduced
  Phillipps and Madame to the Doyen, M. Picquart,
  who was most pleasing and full of knowledge, and promised
  all for England. We here had a contest with John, which
  threatened his being sent home, but he came round before
  the day was out. We started at 10 for Brussels. The
  country not equal to France. We came to the Htel de
  Belle Vue, in the Place Royale. Having engaged a suite of
  rooms, we sat down at once at the <i>table d'hte</i>. After it, I
  went to seek for the Abb Donnet, to whom I had a note
  from Seager. He was out. I then went to Ste. Gudule, the
  cathedral, and saw the Vicaire, a Dutch priest, with whom
  I settled to say mass to-morrow. Then I took a <i>vigilante</i>
  (i.e. a cab) to the College de St. Michel, of the Jesuits, where
  I saw the Second Superior. Then to the Redemptorists,
  where the Superior took up the cause warmly. Home to tea.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, July 10.&mdash;</span>
  Went at 7 to Abb Donnet;
  then to mass at Ste. Gudule. At 9, Abb (Chanoine)
  Donnet called, and, after an hour's talk about Oxford, took
  us to Monsignor Pacci, the Pope's Nuncio, Archbishop of
  Damietta. He is a most holy-looking man; conversed with
  us most kindly; knew much about the Oxford people;
  promised his help. I then let the Phillippses go their way,
  intending to make a day of canvassing convents. But M.
  Donnet took me only to three, and then had to go his way at
  12. The three were:&mdash;

<p class="cite2">

      Augustin. Unique Maison.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
<p class="cite">
  After this, I went to Ste. Gudule, and met Phillipps, with
  whom I went to the Jardin Botanique, and to the hospital
  for old men. It is a grand establishment, by private charity.
  It contains 700 old men, of whom 100 pay for themselves;
  the rest are kept free, and with wonderful regard to their
  comforts. I called on a cur close by, thinking to get the
  prayers of these <i>vielliards</i>; but he took me for a begging
  priest, and turned me out of doors. <i>Deo gratias</i>. Thence
  to the Muse, a collection of pictures, which hardly paid the
  trouble of looking at. After dinner at the <i>table d'hte</i>, we
  took a carriage to go to Jette St. Pierre, to meet the Cardinal
  Archbishop of Malines, at the Convent of the Sacr Coeur
  there. On the way we saw an interesting church; outside was
  a tomb of Madame Malibren. At Jette, Madame de Wall,
  my friend of 1832 at Bordeaux, introduced us to the Cardinal.
  This was a consolation indeed. He undertook to
  recommend England to all the Bishops of Belgium, invited
  me to their meeting on the 29th July, and promised that all
  their priests and convents should engage in the cause. This
  is a noble convent. Madame de Wall said they prayed for
  England every half-hour in the day.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, July 11.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at St. Jacques, in the
  Place Royale. Went to Malines by the <i>chemin du fer</i>,
  Phillipps in the carriage on a truck, I in a <i>char--banc</i>.
  Arrived at l'Htel de la Grue just in time for the <i>table
  d'hte</i>, on which I only remark the immense length of time
  taken to dine. After it, we went to the Petit Sminaire,
  where we were warmly greeted by the Abb Bonquan, our
  friend of Oscott and Grace Dieu. He took us about to a
  few places; and at 5 to the Salut, at the Cathedral; after
  which he introduced Miss Young, the convert, sister
  to Isabella. She went with us to Hanicq's, the printer's,
  and to a fine old church, &amp;c. I visited no convents,
  reserving this for my return. Opposite our hotel, the grand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
  Theatre des Lapons forced itself to be noticed till late at
  night.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, July 12.&mdash;</span>
  After mass and breakfast, we went to
  visit the Cardinal Archbishop, who graciously gave me a
  paper of testimonial, which will, I hope, save some trouble.
  His countenance and manner are highly prepossessing. At
  12 we started for Antwerp, by railway, leaving the carriage
  at the station at Malines. We arrived at the Htel
  St. Antoine, just in time for the <i>table d'hte</i> at 2. There
  I met Mr. Blore, with his daughter, now grown a fine young
  woman. After dinner, to the Cathedral. I need not speak
  of the glorious tower, 466 feet high. What attracted our
  attention most was the wonderfully beautiful restoration of
  the stalls in oak carved work; 40,000 francs have been
  spent in this already, and not half the stalls are finished, and
  this actually in process of work is more pleasing to see than
  the most beautiful morsels of ancient work, for the promise
  it gives of better days. The pulpit is a mass of exquisite
  carving, in a style seemingly favourite in this part of Belgium.
  The most beautiful we saw was at Brussels, Ste. Gudule,
  where, below the preacher, are seen Adam and Eve banished
  from Paradise; and above, the head of the serpent, who
  winds round the pulpit, crushed by Mary. The same style
  of carving is around the pulpit at Marines, Louvain, &amp;c.,
  but is seen no more at Lige. After seeing the cathedral,
  we went to the Muse, containing first-rate specimens of
  Rubens, citizen of Antwerp; as also of Van Dyke and
  Quintin Matsys, of whom there is an excellent picture of
  the Descent from the Cross. Finding myself near the College
  of the Jesuits, I went in and saw the Rector, who took
  up our cause zealously. He walked home with me to
  see Phillipps, and they soon got intimate.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, July 13.&mdash;</span>
  After mass in the cathedral, we
  went, by last night's appointment, to visit the Superior of
  the Jesuits, who showed us his house. Then, Phillipps
  going to see some churches, &amp;c., I went with a lay brother,
  given me for guide by the Superior, to visit convents.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
<p class="cite">
  We called at the following:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite2">
    Coletines, prs la Porte Rouge, 28 nuns
<br><br>
    Dames de l'Instruction Chrtienne, 17 nuns
<br><br>

<br><br>
    Soeurs Grises, 34 nuns
<br><br>
    Soeurs Noires, 49 nuns

    Bguinage (that is, a collection of
      houses, in which Sisters live under
      a Superioress, not bound by vows for life) 54 nuns
</p>
<p class="cite">
  Except the latter, where I was referred to the Director, who
  was not so attentive, all received the proposal warmly. The
  brother was my interpreter with many, who did not know
  French. At 1 we got home, and I took the Phillippses to the
  cur of the cathedral, who introduced to us M. Durlet, the
  young architect, who, with a partner at Louvain, is doing
  the beautiful work in the choir. We went into the cathedral
  again, and I was prevented going to two remaining
  convents, but the cur promised to do it for me. M. Durlet
  came to dine with us at the <i>table d'hte</i>. I just called at
  l'Htel du Park, to see Miss Dalton, who is ill there. Mr.
  Turpin and Mr. Crowe, two Lancashire priests, are with her.
  The former accosted me in the cathedral. We set off then
  to Malines by the railway; there met Abb Bonquan; had
  tea, and went on to Louvain. We got in late, in heavy rain;
  Phillipps had to walk from the railway a mile in the rain.
  I went first to the Htel de Suide, where I found Dr.
  Ullathorne and Mr. Hansom, his architect.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">7th Sunday af. Pent. July 14.&mdash;</span>
  I had my palpitation
  worse than ever to-day. I wish to attribute it to my two
  days' abstinence, and not to my walking after convents. It
  went off after breakfast. I said mass at the Cathedral St.
  Pierre. High mass at 10. It was one of extreme opposition
  to plain chant, with drums and orchestra. In this
  church remember the beautiful tabernacle, a stone pinnacle,
  on the Gospel side of the altar. There was no <i>prne</i>, and a
  second high mass immediately after. The Htel de Ville is
  a famous piece of Gothic, not so admirable to my view as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
  that at Brussels, which is much larger, not so highly wrought,
  and has a beautiful spire. After dinner, at 1, with Dr.
  Ullathorne, and at the <i>table-d'hte</i>, we went to see M. and
  Madame de Coux. We got into interesting talk with him
  on matters religions, ecclesiastical, and political. He is a
  professor of political economy, a Frenchman, brought up
  in England under old Dr. Woods. We went on till after
  5, and so missed the <i>salut</i>, sermon, and procession at the
  church. He took us to the University, where we saw Abb
  Malou, who claimed me as an old acquaintance, one of the
  three at the Collegio Nobile whom I knew at Rome. He
  is Professor of Dogmatic Theology, most learned, high bred,
  and amiable. M. Bonquan came kindly to meet us from
  Malines, and was with us till 6. After having spent nearly
  an hour with M. Malou, who showed us the library (10,000
  vols.) of which he is keeper, we went to tea with M. de Coux,
  and came home at 9.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, July 15. St. Swithin.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at St. Pierre, for
  the Feast <i>de Divisione Apostolorum</i>. After breakfast I went
  again to M. de Coux, who took me to see a M. Mhler, whom
  he recommended as tutor to John Beaumont. At 12, railway
  to Liege. Dined at 5, at l'Htel de France. At 6, <i>salut</i> at
  St. Denys. Before dinner I went to the Redemptorists,
  but found Pre Van Held and Deschamps out of town.
  The Bishop also away. We went at 7 a walk to a bookseller's,
  from which I went in quest of the Grand Vicaire.
  I met an old priest in the street, Abb Marsomme, who took
  me to M. Jacquenot, the second Grand Vicaire, and then
  walked home and took tea with us. These two promised to
  spread prayer for England through Liege. I wrote to Mrs.
  Beaumont before bed.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, July 16.&mdash;</span>
  Our Lady of Mount Carmel.&mdash;Mass
  at St. Denys, where is a beautiful piece of old oak carving.
  Phillippses received communion. After breakfast, at 9, we
  went to high mass at the cathedral. It was solemn plain
  chant. The church has many stained-glass windows, like
  those of Ste. Gudule, Brussels, of 1550, much gone off from
  the older time. The pulpit is new carved oak, with a beautiful
  tower with pinnacles above, a great improvement on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
  the carved pulpit above named, though not so costly perhaps.
  The church is much debased, as usual, in other parts. We
  met Chanoine Erroye, who took us to the other great church,
  St. Jacques, which rivals or surpasses the cathedral. The
  ceiling coloured, though like the cathedral. They are doing
  a great deal to restore this church. The Doyen was there
  overlooking the work. The stained glass was much better
  than at Brussels, but not the best (date 1527); not so far
  down hill. The Chanoine then took us to the Abb Marsomme,
  who is Director of an hospice with 19 nuns, taking
  care of 180 old women, beautifully kept. The Quarant'
  Ore was being celebrated in this church. It is kept up in
  Lige all the year round, and comes four times to each church.
  We then went with the Chanoine Erroye to the Grand Sminaire.
  The library is beautiful. There are here 120 students;
  and at the Petit Sminaire, 360. They go through nine courses
  at the Petit, and three at the Grand, so that 40 are sent on the
  mission every year, and 40 more come on below. Came home to
  <i>table d'hte</i> at 1. After it we made an attempt to go to Angleur,
  3 miles off, where Mrs. Ambrose's father, Hon. Thomas
  Clifford, who died at Lige in 1817, is buried. We were
  stopped by mud and rain, and came back, seeing the church
  of Ste. Croix, which was not very remarkable (<i>Mem</i>. a dog
  carrying the keys as porter), and St. Martin, a fine church
  of second rate, but famous as the place where, at one of the
  side altars, the feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated for the
  first time, owing to the inspirations received by a nun called
  Soeur Julienne. The 6th Centenary will be held in 1846.
  We met a young, amiable-looking priest in the church. He
  promised to think of England at the altar, in the special
  mass of the Blessed Sacrament, which is celebrated at it
  every Thursday, whatever feast may interpose. It was
  heavy rain, and we came home to <i>salut</i> at St. Denys, and
  thence to the hotel. I wrote up a good deal of this journal.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, July 17. St. Osmond.&mdash;</span>
  We took a stouter
  equipage, and got to Angleur early. I said mass, and the
  Phillippses communicated over the place of her father's repose.
  The boys served the mass. The Cur, Matthias Jn. Convardy,
  who remembered Mr. Clifford while himself quite
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
  young, gave us breakfast after, very kindly. All these
  priests were warm for England. We returned to Lige,
  and I went to the banker; then home to dinner at 1. Then
  went off by railway to Aix-la-Chapelle. It passes through
  beautiful romantic scenery. There is no railway with so
  many tunnels in the distance. I got into conversation with
  a party of Oxonians going to spend the long vacation at
  Baden. One of them, Mr. G. F. Brown, of Trinity, was
  full of information, and quite moving on, a great friend of
  W. Palmer, of Magdalen. He promised to visit Oscott.
  We came to the Htel Nuelleus, a very grand one. I went
  to the Chief Canon, the Grand Vicaire being gone to Cologne,
  and got leave for mass to-morrow. We are now in Prussia,
  and all on a sudden all German&mdash;hardly a word of French
  spoken. We had tea, and I finished my Journal up, in my
  room, after saying matins.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, July 18.&mdash;</span>
  I went to the cathedral, and after
  mass, saw the wonderful relics which are preserved in the
  sacristy of the cathedral. This cathedral consists of a round
  Byzantine building, which was built by Charlemagne as the
  chapel to his palace; and a high Gothic choir, which was
  added to it after the palace had been burnt down. A young
  priest showed the relics; he is always in waiting for the
  purpose, except for the time of high mass and office. The
  great relics&mdash;viz., the dress of the Blessed Virgin, the clothes
  which our Lord had on Him on the cross, and the cloth into
  which John Baptist's head fell&mdash;are kept in a magnificent
  chest, which is shown, but is only opened every seven
  years, and when a crowned head comes. The next
  time is July 10, 1846. Above this chest is one containing
  the bones of Charlemagne, whose skull and spine-bone,
  and even hunting-horn, are shown in separate reliquaries.
  His crown and sword are at Vienna. Here is
  shown also the girdle of our Lord, of leather, with Constantine's
  seal upon it; the rope with which he was tied to the
  pillar; the girdle of Our Lady; and many other glorious
  relics less important. The interior of the doors enfolding
  these treasures is lined most beautifully with paintings of
  Albert Durer, and many admirable Byzantine paintings.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
  These relics were principally given to Charlemagne by the
  Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. The cases were gifts of several
  emperors, &amp;c., as Lothaire, Charles V., Philip II. They
  were preserved in the French Revolution by a priest, who
  conveyed them to Paderborn and hid them. After breakfast
  I returned to the cathedral with Phillipps for high mass,
  which was in solemn plain chant, and then saw the relics
  again at 11, after going to the Palais de Justice. At 12 I
  got a little dinner, and went by the railway to Grand, parting
  from the Phillippses, please God, for a fortnight only.
  I went to bed at the Htel de Flandre, leaving no
  luggage&mdash;all left at Malines.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, July 19.&mdash;</span>
  Went to the cathedral to say mass.
  My morning was taken up with going to the railway about
  my poor luggage, which at last I saw, and visiting the Provincial
  of the Jesuits, to see about my retreat. I dined at
  the hotel. The cathedral is a most beautiful specimen of
  the Greek fittings in a Gothic church. I did not stop to
  have the finest pictures uncovered, for I had my business to
  see after. Two other beautiful churches, St. Nicholas and
  St. Michael. No signs here of Gothic restorations. At 3 I
  went with the Provincial to Franchismes, where they have
  bought an ancient Prmontr Abbey, which does not preserve
  much of the abbey still, except some corridors, once,
  as it seems, cloisters. It is, however, a beautiful establishment
  for its end. I saw and spoke to two English and one
  Irish novice, of course about England. I went back to
  Gand; and there Pre Coultins, by desire of the Provincial,
  went with me to the Recollets, a reform of the Franciscans;
  their chief house is at St. Froud. Then to the Pauvres
  Claires; and then to one of the two Bguinages. Here are
  establishments, in one of which 800, and in the other 300,
  <i>quasi</i> nuns live in a cluster of separate houses.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  Their origin is immemorial. They are bound by vows of
  obedience and chastity, not poverty, for the time that they
  remain. Hardly ever does one return to the world. The
  Pre Coultins promised to visit for me the other convents of
  the town. This is what I could do for Ghent. At 6, I
  started by railway to Louvain, where I was received as an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
  old acquaintance at the Htel de Suide. The Provincial
  sends me here for my retreat. In the train to Malines, I
  had Mr. Maude and Mr. Perry. Finished Journal, and to
  bed at near 12.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, July 20.&mdash;</span>
  After mass at the cathedral, and
  breakfast, I went to the Seminary of the Jesuits, with a
  letter from the Provincial to Pre Rosa, the rector. He
  introduced me to Pre Vanderghote, who is to direct my
  retreat, and left me with him. We went to walk about
  the town, called on M. Malou, who undertook to translate
  a prayer from Dr. Wiseman's prayers for England, into
  French. I called on Mr. De Coux, and at I dined with
  these two fathers, and we went into the garden. I then
  wrote to Dr. Wiseman, Phillipps, and M. Bonquan, and
  at  to 5 began my retreat for eight days please God, till
  the end of which my present journal intermits. <i>Orate pro
  me omnes qui diligitis Deum</i>.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, July 29.&mdash;</span>
  I rose this morning out of my retreat,
  hoping that by the help of Almighty God I may preserve
  some of its fruit durably. I said mass once more at 7
  in the private chapel, then after a conversation with my
  kind Father Vanderghote, I went to the College du Saint
  Esprit, where I saw M. Malou, and then went into the
  hall, where theses were defended by a young priest called
  Bacten, and then degrees conferred, and a discourse in
  Latin pronounced by Abb Malou. The Nuncio and the
  Bishop of Amiens were there, with many others. At 2 I
  dined with M. Malou. The chief guests were the Grand
  Vicaire de Bruges, a monseigneur, and Abb Marais, of
  the Sorbonne; much conversation was on England, and
  some good interest excited. I went again to see Pre Rosa,
  and Vanderghote, and at 6 was on the railway to Malines
  with a multitude of priests. I went to the Petit Sminaire,
  and supped, and M. Bonquan walked with me to
  the Grue.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, July 30.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at the cathedral, and
  then at 8 went to the Archbishop's palace, where, with
  much trouble, I got at the Chanoine's private secretary, who
  introduced me to the Cardinal and his five suffragan Belgian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
  Bishops of Bruges, Tournay, Gand, Namur, and Liege,
  sitting after breakfast. I sat down, and in a short conversation
  a great deal seemed to be done for the cause. I was
  desired to draw up documents with M. Bonquan to-day,
  and to dine with the prelates at 1 to-morrow, to hear their
  conclusion. <i>Laus Deo semper</i>. At 10 I went to M.
  Bonquan, where I found two young Oxford men, whom I
  afterwards found were Christie of Oriel and his brother.
  They went with M. Bonquan and me on all our rounds
  to the convents of the town to-day. At 12 I dined at the
  Petit Sminaire, then, with M. Bonquan and M. Vandervelde,
  who was very zealous for England, I began to
  prepare for to-morrow; at 4 the Christies came, and we
  walked till 7. The convents which we went to, and which
  all promised, and (except one which was cold) all with
  great warmth, were:&mdash;

  Lastly, we visited a new house and institute called Frres
  de la Misricorde, lately founded by a canon of the cathedral,
  by name Scheppers. There are now 27 brothers, of
  whom 25 are on their mission, which is to enter, several
  together, the prisons of the country, and devote themselves
  to the spiritual and bodily care and cure of the prisoners.
  The Government favours them remarkably; it seems a most
  notable institution, and the founder was a most interesting
  man. He promised warmly to engage all his brethren. At
  7 I went to the station, and met Elwes, on his way home
  from Kissengen. I brought him up, and we had supper at
  the Grue. I went to bed after a good bit of work to be
  got up, office, Journal, account, &amp;c.

<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, July 31. St. Ignatius.&mdash;</span>
  Elwes and I said
  mass at the cathedral. From 10 till near 1 he and I were
  both at work copying an address for the Bishops, of which
  I thought to give each a copy. At one I went to dine at
  the Cardinal's. There were there six Bishops and the
  Nuncio, and many of the chief clergy. I sat next to
  Mgr. de Namur; afterwards I took an hour's walk in the
  garden, and at 4 attended the meeting of the Bishops, who
  came to a happy resolution of granting an indulgence of
  40 days for every mass, every communion, even hearing
  mass, or saying it with a memento for England, and reciting
  a prayer which they determined on. The Cardinal was full
  of noble kindness. This grant was more than I had proposed
  in my paper, and so my morning's work and Elwes's
  was useless in a very agreeable way. I went to the Grue
  and found M. Bonquan and the Christies with Elwes.
  In packing up I found my passport was lost, and went off,
  therefore, uncertain whether I could pass the frontier without
  writing for one to Brussels. The Christies travelled
  with me. I had some interesting conversation with each
  about their position in the Church of England. They took
  it with great gentleness, and answered well. They seem
  not to have thought of coming over, and yet to be in
  good disposition to do what they shall see right. We met
  very agreeably with the very priest of whom we have heard
  so much, who learnt English to instruct a lady in his
  parish near Bruges, whose daughter was already a convert,
  and writes letters to Dr. Wiseman for publication in England
  (Miss Heron). We became great friends, and he, with
  another young priest, his neighbour, who are taking a little
  tour together, came with us to the Aigle Noir, nearer the
  Redemptorists than l'Htel de France. We were very
  nearly upset in the omnibus, as we came up from the
  station; it was overloaded with luggage, and struck the
  wheels on the right in the sand, having got off the paving.
  We got out, unhurt, into another omnibus passing by;
  supper, and to bed.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, August 1.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at the Redemptorists. Le
  Pre Van Held invited us all to breakfast, i.e., the Christies
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
  and the priests, our new friends. I met there the Bishop's
  secretary, who gave me a letter to the Governor of Liege,
  Baron Van der Stein, who, happily, was come this morning
  into town, and gave me my passport. I then went on with
  my <i>vigilante</i> to see the Miss Nicholls, who have been living
  two years at the Benedictine convent, Quai d'Avroy. I
  met them last at Boulogne, in 1838. They promised to be
  busy in getting prayers. I then visited the Jesuits' College,
  and Abb Marsomme. Dined at 1 at the <i>table d'hte</i> with
  the Christies, whom Pre Van Held had sent about sight-seeing
  with one of his priests. At 2.45 we took the convoy
  to Cologne, which we reached duly at 9, and went to the
  Htel du Douane, Gasthof zum Klner Dom, close to the
  cathedral; we took a walk round the cathedral by moonlight
  after supper.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, August 2.&mdash;</span>
  I went to say mass in the cathedral,
  which we then looked round. It gives a melancholy spectacle
  of what miserable times have been gone through while
  it remained thus unfinished so long; but it is a consolation
  to see the glorious restoration now going on. The most
  beautiful points of the decoration of the choir are the fresco
  paintings above the pillars, and the rich gilded diapering on
  the lower part of them round the choir, in which one column
  alone is finished; and beautiful figures under canopies on
  each column, half-way to the top. The building is surrounded
  with great masses of stones for the completing of it. It is
  expected that it will be finished, fit for consecration, in four
  years, but not quite complete till twenty years hence, please
  God, if we have peace. After breakfast we went to call on
  Professor Michel, at the Seminary. He could not come
  with us. We saw the Jesuits' church, and returned to assist
  at part of a requiem mass at the cathedral, the anniversary
  of the Archbishop Ferdinand. I spoke to the Vicar-General
  about England, then went home, wrote to M. Malou, dined
  alone; and at 1 set off by a steamboat on the Rhine for
  Koenigswinter, parting from the Christies in the boat. I
  had nothing very remarkable in the passage; reached
  Koenigswinter at 5. I took up my lodgings at the Htel
  de Berlin, where the Phillippses had been for twelve days.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
  They came in from a ride in the mountains about 6, and we
  went to tea with Count and Countess Kurtzrock. He is
  Mrs. Ambrose's second cousin. Their daughter Marie and
  her governess gave us music.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, August 3.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at the little church at Sta.
  Maria. The altar with altar-cloth only over the altar stone.
  The rest of the altar was brown wood. We breakfasted
  with Mrs. P.'s aunt, La Baronne de Veich, whom they are
  visiting. She lives in a small house with two nieces, Antoinette
  and Fanny Lutzou. At 10 we went across the Rhine
  to Gothsburg, a watering-place, where Mrs. Amherst and
  daughter have been staying; but they are gone to Italy. We
  walked up to a castle battered into ruin in the Thirty Years'
  war, overhanging the town. The little church half-way up
  the hill is a bad specimen of taste enough inside. We came
  back to dinner at the Baroness's at 2. I went home for
  two hours, then walked with Phillipps and Tony, as they call
  Antoinette, to see a house which she is undertaking to form
  into an asylum for old poor women; back to tea, and home
  to the hotel at 9.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, August 4. 10th after Pentecost, here marked 9th.&mdash;</span>
  I heard mass at 7 with the famous Kirchen Gesang,
  of whom I heard from Dr. Sweers while translating Overbury's
  Life. All the people sang German hymns through the whole
  mass with wonderful unison. After it I said mass. At 10
  was the high mass, i.e., another mass with Kirchen Gesang,
  rather more solemn; and a sermon. I came home then and
  wrote a letter to the Vicar-General at Cologne. I received
  from M. Bonquan my book of papers pro Anglia, which I
  had left at Malines. At 1, dinner. Professor Schutz, of
  the University of Bonn, came to dine. We saw him off at
  3, and then found that some one must go to Bonn to get
  money from the bank; so I took the charge, that I might
  see Bonn. I crossed the Rhine in a boat, and met an
  omnibus which took me on the road I travelled in 1820.
  The cathedral at Bonn, called the Mnster, is of a style
  older than Gothic, but not quite Byzantine, something like
  our Saxon churches. The choir is elevated high above the
  nave, which sinks below the level outside, or the outside
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
  must have risen. Some arches are Gothic. The University
  is a large building, what would be called Grecian. In front
  of it is a handsome promenade or park. At 7 I called a
  second time at Professor Schutz's house, and found him with
  M. Marais, of the Sorbonne. He gave me coffee, &amp;c. His
  rooms are full of curiosities from Palestine and Egypt. In
  1819, 1820, and 1821, he was travelling, commissioned by
  Government, a literary journey through Egypt, Abyssinia, &amp;c.
  He is Professor of Scripture, a great Orientalist, a friend of
  Dr. Wiseman's. We spoke about Humanarianism and Overbury,
  and the Paris University, &amp;c. I went out and met
  my omnibus at a  to 9, crossed the Rhine, and got home
  at 10.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, August 5. Sta. Maria ad Nives.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at 7;
  at 9 we went to a high mass de requiem. They always
  sing one for every person who dies; and when the family
  can afford it, bread is given to the poor, as was done to-day.
  I stayed at home nearly, till one, then dinner at la Baronne's.
  Mr. Ambrose was not there, having had a fall
  yesterday, and taking rest for precaution. After dinner,
  looked over the Life of Napoleon in German; came home
  till I went to tea. The Count and Countess Kurtzrock and
  daughters came. The Countess promised to be an associate
  for England, and to spread it at Hamburg, where they live.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, August 6th.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at 6. I started at 7.30 by a
  steamer for Mayence. We passed Coblentz (lat. <i>confluentia</i>),
  at the confluence of the Moselle and the Rhine, at 1, and
  then dined (<i>table d'hte</i>) on deck. We made agreeable
  acquaintance with two priests, M. Bandry, Chanoine of
  Cologne, and M. Steigmeier, a P.P. in the Black Forest. The
  first went off at Coblentz, the second spoke only Latin;
  both were highly interested for England. I was busy a good
  deal with reading German, with a dictionary. The weather
  was beautiful till about 6, when suddenly a terrible squall
  of wind, and thunder and lightning came on. The steamer
  was driven aground on a sand-bank, and seemed likely to
  capsize with the wind and waves. Terrible fright and
  crying among ladies and children. We seemed to think
  little of the rain and lightning which gleamed on every side
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
  of us. It was very frightful; at least, it appeared so, and I
  saw what a warning was given here to be ready at a moment.
  No great preparation, I found, would be likely to be
  made in a time like that. It brought on me a palpitation
  which lasted till morning. We got off after ten minutes,
  as the storm blew over, and got to the Htel du Rhine
  at Mayence (Mainz) about 9. My greatest alarm since
  Messina.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Aug. 7. San. Gaetano. Remembered Affi,
  1820.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at the cathedral. This is a venerable old
  church, St. Boniface's see. It is something like our Norman
  style of architecture; at the west end is a remarkable
  baptistery, with a high vaulted roof now opening to the
  church. There are many fine monuments, and many more
  of the worst style; fauns and dragons supporting archbishops,
  &amp;c. They showed us a holy-water stoup, where
  Gustavus Adolphus, having ridden into the church, made
  his horse drink! Near the church is a statue of Guttenburg,
  the first printer, claimed as a citizen of Mainz; bas-reliefs by
  Thorwaldsen. We had not time to see more. I was not
  disposed, with my palpitation just subsiding, to go after the
  Archbishop or others. We started past for Manheim; on
  the way we looked at the torn-down cathedral of Worms,
  in a later style than Mayence, and very venerable. This
  place was famous in the contests between Charles V. and
  Luther. We dined at Manheim, then took the railway to
  Heidelberg, where we put up at the Badische Hof. We
  saw nothing at Manheim but the appearance of the town,
  which is very handsome. A French gentleman whom I met
  in the town, Girardon, of Lyons, said the ducal palace was
  very grand.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, Aug. 8.&mdash;</span>
  I went out at 9, having had rather
  a bad night, and said mass at the Jesuits' old church, which
  is now the only exclusively Catholic church in Heidelberg.
  The cur lives in an old college; the church was dreary and
  empty, and things seem to be at a low point. We went
  after breakfast in a carriage to the ruins of the castle, which
  are fine in their way, but not of the right style. Luther
  was fostered here by the Elector Palatine. It was burnt by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
  lightning in 1764. In the altar we saw the great tun,
  which is no wonder to my mind. At 11 we took the
  railway to Baden, through Carlsruhe. There we took a
  walk before dinner, saw the gaming-table, which is a famous
  occupation here; I never saw one before in a public saloon.
  I met Mr. Woollett. a Catholic of London, and his two
  daughters. He wants confession to an English priest, and
  I went with him to the convent of the Sepulchrines to see
  about it. They promised prayers for England. 12 nuns;
  the same order as New Hall; dinner at 5. Then we took a
  carriage to the ruins of the old castle, much grander than at
  Heidelberg. I did not venture to go up the castle, as I felt
  myself not fit. We came back to tea with Mrs. Craven,
  ne La Ferronaye, wife of the English <i>Charg d'affaires</i>,
  who is a convert. We met l'Abb Martin de Nerlieu,
  cur de S. Jaques  Paris, and his vicaire, and Miss Jane
  Young. Home at 9.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, August 9.&mdash;</span>
  I had to take a carriage and go at 6
  o'clock to Lichtenthal, a mile or two from Baden, where the
  Herr Landherr is cur, and has power to give leave to hear
  confessions. There is a convent there of 18 nuns, Bernardines,
  who promised to pray for England. I returned and
  said mass at the convent in Baden, having first heard the
  confessions of Mr. Woollett and Miss Young's maid. I
  thought that night, as I lay in bed with my heart beating,
  that I must see a doctor to-day, and consult about the propriety
  of travelling; but the Phillippses both reasoned
  against this, and I saw it differently by daylight. We
  dined at the <i>table d'hte</i> at 1, and then set off on our way
  towards Munich. We travelled to-day through the grand
  scenery of the Black Forest, and arrived at 9 at Neuenburg,
  where there was a very civil host, and a nice inn, though a
  second rate.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, August 10. St. Lawrence.&mdash;</span>
  The first, I think,
  (no, except 1835), on which I have lost mass since my
  priesthood; but there was no Catholic church. We made a
  slow day's journey; we began badly by going the first stage
  to Wildbad, from which we returned nearly to Neuenburg,
  as it seemed on our road right. The reason was, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
  thought, that they directed us wrong yesterday, and sent us
  a longer road, whereas we should have got straight to Wildbad,
  without going to Neuenburg. We should have had a
  chapel at Wildbad, where a priest came during the season
  only. We got to Stuttgard at 5, and had a splendid dinner
  at the hotel. We met an old courier of Mr. Phillipps's,
  afterwards clerk at the Foreign Office, who lives here on
  a pension from England. He knew Cavani. He lives now
  at this hotel. Stuttgard seems an uninteresting place for a
  capital; has 4,000 inhabitants only. It is well to have seen
  it. We went on again in the evening to get to Gppingen,
  where we we were told there was a Catholic church, and we
  did not get to bed till 2; I fasting for to-morrow, and fearing
  a bad night.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Htel de la Poste, Sunday, Aug. 11.&mdash;</span>
  I slept well, after
  all. I got up at 8, and we started directly in heavy rain for
  Gross Eplingen, two miles on our way, where the nearest
  Catholic church was. There was none in Gppingen. We
  arrived at the middle of the parochial mass. The Kirchen
  Gesangen are very impressive. After it I said mass, and after
  visiting the pastor, we went on to Ulm, which we reached
  at 5 about. Radhoff (Wheat) Hotel. Before dinner we
  went and spent a long time in the old cathedral, now a
  Lutheran church, and for that reason, however strangely,
  preserved wonderfully from spoiling. It was most magnificent;
  the aisles divided by most elegant pillars, a most
  glorious tabernacle, still standing, far surpassing Louvain.
  The old triptic, with a beautiful group in wood-carving,
  still over the altar; a beautiful pulpit in the style of the
  tabernacle; the screen was gone; and the stained glass preserved
  only in the choir and one or two more places; but so
  far, I thought it the richest I knew. It was wonderful how
  much better was the appearance of the church than if
  it had been in Catholic hands. After dinner was busy upstairs
  till 10.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, Aug. 12.&mdash;</span>
  Got up at 5; we were taken to the
  Catholic church, a poor thing, compared with the ancient
  one. I said mass there at 8; at 9 we started for Augsburg.
  There was nothing remarkable on the way but the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
  excessive slowness of the Bavarian post-boys; they are remarkable,
  I believe, among the Germans. We dined about
  5, at a small town called Tusmarchausan, a neat, clean,
  country town. Talked French with an old Italian who
  attends at the inn, and Latin with a Dominican priest, in a
  blue great-coat and Hessian boots. We set off again at 7,
  and reached Augsburg at 9 or 10. Put up at the Three
  Moors,&mdash;Drei Mohren.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Aug. 13.&mdash;</span>
  Went to say mass at the Church of
  St. Ulrick, at the altar of St. Afra, whose body was shown
  in a glass case over it, as it is within the octave of her feast.
  She was martyred at Augsburg, under Domitian. After
  breakfast, I went to the bank, then to the cathedral,
  where there was a high mass <i>de requiem</i>; then I went to
  seek the Chanoine Stadler, a great friend of the English. I
  first saw another canon, and the Dean, at the consistorium;
  spoke about England. I found Canon Stadler at a convent
  called <i>of the English nuns</i>, because founded by English 200
  years ago; an examination of the girls under education was
  going on. The Regierung's President and other personages
  were there. I sat near the canon at this for half an hour;
  then went home to dinner. There came to dine a Scotch
  Kirk minister, who was at the convent which I visited,
  Mr. &mdash;&mdash; He is almost a Catholic in doctrine, but is
  connected with the Apostolics in England, and so has, I
  think, no disposition to turn now. Canon Stadler came late
  to dinner, and persuaded me to put off our journey to Munich
  from the three to the seven o'clock train. He took us to the
  Church of the Holy Cross, to see the miraculous Host,
  which, in 1194, was stolen by a woman of Augsburg, taken
  home, and wrapped in wax. After five years, she confessed
  it, and brought it back. On opening the wax, the priest
  found the appearance changed into that of flesh and blood.
  It has been preserved ever since, and has been the means of
  many miracles. We saw it in an <i>ostensoire</i>, quite bright-red.
  The choir of the church is surrounded with pictures
  on the subject. We then went to the convent again, from,
  whence the Scotch gentleman took me to the bishop, whom
  we found near the cathedral. He talked no French, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
  recommended England as I could in Latin. We went to
  the Canon Stadler's house, where the Phillippses were
  waiting; we parted from him, and came and had tea at
  the Hof, and then took railway to Munich. We reached
  the Bayerische Hof, Htel de Bavire, at 9 3/4. This is one
  of the largest hotels in Europe, they say.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Aug. 14. Vigil of the Assumption.&mdash;</span>
  I said
  mass in the cathedral, which is near our hotel. It is a high,
  large building, but very much disfigured. We all stayed
  at home till 12; then Phillipps and I went to call on
  Dr. Dllinger, who was out. I had to dine alone, as it is
  reckoned wrong for a priest to <i>manger gras</i> on a fasting day
  in public. After dinner, we all went to see the new Church
  of St. Louis, decorated splendidly by the King. Then the
  Church of St. Blaise in the faubourg, also decorated by him,
  both built by the town. We thought them very beautiful,
  but decidedly falling short of the right mark in point of
  style. In Ludwig Church is a <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of Cornelius,
  "The Last Judgment." It is not to our taste, nor to the
  king's; for Cornelius went away to Berlin, disgusted with
  the king's not admiring it. Among other defects, there are
  no real altars, only portable stones to be let into scagliola
  altars, which in Ludwig Kirche are all exactly one like the
  other. At 7, I went to the Franciscan convent, to confess
  to Pre Constantius. He introduced me to the Provincial
  and community at supper. I spoke of England in
  lame Latin. At supper, in the hotel, we were joined by
  Mr. Wake, son of the Rev. Mr. Wake, of Courtene Hall,
  who recognised me, after about seventeen years. He alarmed
  us with his idea that a war will break out between France
  and England about Pritchard. What a war would this be!
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, Aug. 15. Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.&mdash;</span>
  I had some difficulty in getting leave to hear the
  Phillippses' confessions, but I succeeded, and said mass at
  nine, during the high mass, with drums and all sort of music.
  We went again to mass at 11; then Phillipps and I went
  and found Dllinger, who came back and dined with us at
  the <i>table d'hte</i>. Then we walked with him to see Mr. and
  Mrs. Phillipps. He is a Professor of law, son of an Englishman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
  in Prussia. Then we went to see old Mr. Gorres, one of
  the first minds in Germany. At 8, we went to tea with
  Mr. and Mrs. Rio, the sister to Jones of Llanarth. We
  found there Mr. Dugdale, a northern English priest, and
  others. The conversation was very agreeable. Mrs. Rio
  is very infirm with sciatica, or settled pains like it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, Aug. 16.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at the cathedral at 11. We
  went with Mr. Dugdale to the Pinacotheke, a grand building
  of this king, containing the vast collection of pictures
  which I saw with Lefevre at Schlussheim in 1820. What
  struck me most was the gallery on one side of the building,
  ornamented like Raphael's, in the Vatican. We dined at
  two; then went to see the new palace, which is opened at
  times regularly to all visitors. We went among a party of
  all sorts. I was recognised by Lady Lowther&mdash;that was, at
  least. This was from Lowther Castle, 1816. In the palace,
  the floors are beautiful wood-work, inlaid. Some rooms
  have fine pictures of the former German history, of Charlemagne,
  Barbarossa, Rodolph of Hapsburg, &amp;c. The hall
  of audience is surrounded with striking colossal statues of
  ancient dukes of Bavaria. We cannot say much for the
  two rooms of Bavarian beauties; the king's fondness for
  them is not edifying, they say. From the palace we went
  to the studios; at half-past 7 went to tea at Dr. Dllinger's,
  and met almost all whom we visited yesterday,
  and, besides, Mr. Windischmann, canon of the cathedral.
  I got a long conversation with him in English. He became
  very zealous for promoting the prayers for England. There
  was there Mr. Raby, of Leicester, who was at Munich with
  his mother; his sister is become a nun at Nymphenburg.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, Aug. 17.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at the cathedral at 8.
  After breakfast, I visited Mr. and Mrs. Farrell and their
  family, who are in this hotel. He is uncle to John Farrell. She
  said she had seen me at Leamington with Mr. Martyn. Then
  Count de Senufft Pilsach, Austrian ambassador, to whom
  Mr. Phillipps brought a note from Father Lythgoe, called. We
  then walked to the palace, and saw the rich chapel, in which
  many relics are kept in cases of gold and silver, with pearls
  and jewels, some carved by Benvenuto Cellini; the right hand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
  of St. John Baptist and St. Chrysostom among them, and
  some earth stained with the blood of Our Lord. A little
  triptic used on the scaffold by Mary Queen of Scots. We
  then went to the palace of the Duc de Leuchtenberg, son of
  Eugene Beauharnais. One room full of modern paintings,
  and another much larger, with a very choice collection of
  the Italian and Flemish schools, struck me. Dr. Dllinger
  dined with us, and then took us to the Public Library, a
  magnificent building, calculated for 1,000,000 volumes, and
  containing now 500,000, lately built by Ludwig I. We
  stayed a long time looking about it, and then went on to the
  University, another new building, very splendid. Dr.
  Dllinger is rector this next year. The library here is of
  200,000 vols.; he is the chief librarian of it. We returned
  at 8, looking in, <i>en passant</i>, to the Ludwig Kirche. A
  beautiful sunset.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, August 18.&mdash;</span>
  I went by invitation to say mass at
  the Auer Kirche, <i>i.e.</i>, the new Gothic church in the suburb
  Au. Trusting to the fine sunset of last night, I took no
  umbrella, and very nearly got a wetting before I got home.
  At 9, Mr. Schlager called on me. He is studying the law,
  and looks so smart that I did not of myself recognize him.
  We went to high mass at the Theatine church. At 12, I
  went with Mr. Windischmann, to be presented to the Nuncio,
  Mgr. Vichi, to plead for England. I could not do much, as
  other visitors came in. After dinner, we went to seek
  vespers unsuccessfully at the Theatine church. At 5, we
  took a carriage, and went to the Sisters of Charity, where we
  got on badly for want of German, and saw nothing but the
  church, where service was going on. We then went to the
  public cemetery, near it. It is in the style of Pre la Chaise,
  but inferior. What is remarkable is the place where the
  bodies newly dead are exposed for three days before burial.
  We saw several behind glass windows, dressed out and
  adorned with flowers. After coming home, I went at 7 to
  Professor Grres's. He has open house for the circle of his
  friends every Sunday evening. Dr. Dllinger wished us all
  to go, but Phillipps thought it hardly proper without an
  invitation. There were twelve at supper; among them Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
  Dllinger, Phillipps, Moy. The party was very agreeable,
  though I knew nothing of the German conversation, except
  what Dr. Dllinger translated to me. I came home at
  half-past 10.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, August 19.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass at the cathedral. Mrs.
  Dugdale came after breakfast, and went with us to the
  Glyptotheke, where are some fine pieces of ancient sculpture.
  I suppose the AEgina marbles are among the most valued.
  They are of an earlier style than the perfect models of Greek
  sculpture, finely designed but stiff. The whole thing is too
  heathenish and so immodest. It is a mystery to me how all
  these sights are consistent with Catholic principle, especially
  the Venuses and Adonises by Christian masters, like
  Canova. The building is very noble. We went thence
  to what was far more satisfactory, the Basilica, built on the
  plan of the old church of St. Paul, at Rome, 300 feet long,
  with two ranges of glorious holy pictures, one range being
  the whole history of our English St. Boniface. I hope this
  is there as a memorial of what Germany owes to England,
  and as an excitement to pray for us. I came back to receive
  Mr. Schlager to dine with me at the <i>table d'hte</i>. Phillipps
  dined at Mr. Rio's, where I joined them at 3, having first
  gone with Mr. Schlager to his lodgings. Rio talked
  splendidly about England, and Dr. Dllinger promised to
  write articles to call to prayer for it. I came home at 5,
  said office in the cathedral, and at 7 we went to supper
  with Dr. and Mrs. Phillipps, where we met all the circle,
  the Grreses, Windischman, Dllinger, Rios, Mrs. Raby,
  Mrs. Dugdale, &amp;c.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, August 20. St. Bernard.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at the cathedral
  at 10. I took a carriage and went with Mrs. Dugdale
  and Mrs. Raby to Nymphenburg, where is the principal
  convent of the English nuns, of which I saw a house at
  Augsburg. There are ten houses in Bavaria; Mrs. Raby's
  daughter is a novice there. We stopped a good while, and
  I hope a good step was taken in my work. Mr. Dugdale
  promises to follow up ardently the begging prayers. I came
  home before 2, and stayed at home till 5, when we went with
  the two boys to a grand dinner with le Comte de Zeuft,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
  the Austrian ambassador. There were twenty at table:
  the Nuncio, Mr. Aebel, minister of the interior, the chief
  Catholic physician, a Polish Countess Kitzka, and all our
  friends the Professors were there. I sat between Dr.
  Phillipps and Windischman. We stayed till near 10. The
  Comte de Zeuft promised great help for England. It is my
  first opening in Austria. Mrs. Aebel assured me that the
  Government would be well pleased with whatever was done
  in this way, which is a great point secured. I also had an
  interesting talk on the subject with the Countess Kitzka,
  who proposed prayer for Poland also on Saturdays. This
  was, in short, a productive evening.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, August 21.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at the cathedral. I
  walked with Mr. Dugdale to the convent of Sisters of Providence
  joining the great hospital we failed in entering on
  Sunday. We got one nun who spoke a little French to show
  us over the hospital, but we made little of gaining prayers.
  I found palpitations coming from the walk, and so I came
  home and stayed till I went with Phillipps to dine at 4 with
  the Nuncio. The chief guests were Comte de Zeuft and
  Baron Frujberg, <i>conseilleur d'tat</i>, and twelve or fourteen
  more. The Nuncio took charge of the little prayer for
  England adopted by the Belgian bishops, and promised to
  get ample indulgences at Rome for the masses, communions,
  and prayers for England. We came home and took Mrs.
  Phillipps to tea at Dr. Dllinger's, Baron Frujberg, Rio,
  Hffler, the historian of the German popes of the 11th
  century.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, August 22.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at 8. I stayed at home
  writing to Dr. Wiseman from 11 to 12; then went with Dr.
  Dllinger to be presented to Madame di Frujberg, and her
  sister Amelia de Mongeras. Talked about England and
  prayers. At home I found Comte de Zeuft and the Nuncio
  paying a visit. Then dinner at 2. Mr. Windischman
  took me to see the Archbishop, 84 years old. He has his
  intellect quite sound, and was favourable to the prayers, but
  not very zealous. I came home and stayed till 7, writing
  to Mrs. Beaumont and Mrs. Canning, saying office, &amp;c.
  At 7 Mr. and Mrs. Rio and two children, Dr. Phillipps,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
  Dllinger, and Windischman came to tea and supper, so a parting
  visit. Little Miss Rio got sick with the smoke in the salon.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, August 23.&mdash;</span>
  Mass at 7 in the cathedral for the
  last time. After breakfast a visit from Mr. Dugdale and
  old Grres, and a talk with Mr. Woodwich, a very nice
  young Anglican, whom Phillipps met at Cologne, and came
  yesterday to Munich. The horses came for our departure
  at 11, but we did not start till  to 1. I sat in the carriage
  saying office. We had a pretty journey, approaching a line
  of fine mountains. We reached a town called Tegern See,
  and we put up at Le Troitteur Hof. When we came to
  dine, we found ourselves worse off than we have yet been.
  No bread without aniseed, and hardly enough to eat for all
  but me, who took meat. However, this is an interesting
  spot. Out of my window I have a sweet view of the lake
  and mountains opposite, with a bright moon upon them.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, August 24.&mdash;</span>
  I went before 7 to find the old
  priest to say mass. The church is a handsome one attached
  to a large building which once was a Benedictine convent,
  but was turned by the old king, my former acquaintance,
  into a country palace. Prince Charles lives here now. The
  old priest was one of the monks. There are four now alive
  out of forty-three. We started at 9, and went through
  beautiful mountain scenery, especially that part of the road
  which lies along the bank of Achensee, a beautiful blue lake.
  We dined at about 2, at Achenthal, just before coming to the
  lake. We were delayed by a spring breaking, and only
  reached Schwartz, a town of 4,500 people. The inn La Pote
  is kept by Anthony Reiner, one of a family of three men and
  a sister, who about 1830 were 2 years in England, singing
  Tyrolese songs, and made 4,000. Mrs. Ambrose heard
  them at Sir Thomas Acland's. We had tea in the billiard-room,
  and saw some beautiful play.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, Aug. 25.&mdash;</span>
  I said mass at 6, at the Franciscan
  church. In the convent are twenty-one priests and twenty-five
  students, besides lay brothers. I recommended England
  and was kindly heard. After breakfast we went together
  to the parish church; at 8 a sermon begins&mdash;we heard the
  end of it, preached by a Franciscan. Mass follows the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
  sermon. The style of music, both here and in the Franciscan
  church, where I heard part of the high mass, is high
  figured. We set off for Innspruck after. It was raining all
  the way. We arrived at 2 at the Golden Sun (die goldene
  Sonne), in a fine wide street. We had dinner, during which
  we were surprised and pleased by a visit from Mrs. Amherst
  and Mary. She has a house in this street, and saw us pass
  by. Three daughters are with her. Soon after we went to
  see the Franciscan church, in which is the famous monument
  of Maximilian, and round it bronze figures of illustrious
  personages, and on the side a marble monument of
  Hoffa. They are not all saints, and it is thought to be an
  unbecoming ornament to a church. They certainly cause
  distractions by the number of people who come to see the
  sculpture, which makes this small church almost like a
  Glyptotheke. After this, Mrs. Amherst took me to the
  Redemptorists, where Father Prost talks English, and received
  me most cordially, and presented me to the Rector.
  I then went to the Franciscan convent, where, as at
  Munich, I saw the fathers at supper, and recommended
  England to the Provincial, who promised to convey my
  wishes to the 300 subjects of the 10 houses of his province.
  In this little house there are eight priests. He sent a man
  to take me to the Decanus, living near the parish church, to
  ask for leave to hear confessions to-morrow. He was a most
  amiable, kind old man, and promised to speak for me to all
  the clergy. I went to meet our party at tea with the
  Amhersts at 7, and had a very pleasant evening. Home
  at 9.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, Aug. 26th.&mdash;</span>
  Father Prost gave himself to me
  all to-day. I went to say mass at the Redemptorist church;
  breakfasted there; then went out with him to the hospital
  of the Sisters of Charity, where there are 15 nuns, and it is
  the mother house of about eight houses in all. They are
  under the direction of the Redemptorists. Then to the
  Jesuits' college, where we saw the Rector; then to dine
  with the Redemptorists at 12. They are about ten in
  number. The Rector is most zealous for my cause. At 2
  we walked out of the town to a fine Premonstratensian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
  abbey to which belong 42 monks; but about half are
  employed as coadjutors to parish priests. The Abbot
  received us very kindly, and showed us all over his house,
  which has a great suite of fine rooms, full of pictures of
  great personages. We came back to settle for my departure
  to-morrow; and lastly visited the Servites. They have a
  fine large house in the great street. Their number is only
  fifteen. Lastly, we called on a lady who can talk English,
  having learned it, where Father Prost did, in America. I
  went at 6 to tea with the Amhersts, among whom I also
  found William just come. I went home to stay at the
  Redemptorists, in order to be able to say mass to-morrow.
  The Rector and Father Prost sat some time with me.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Aug. 27th.&mdash;</span>Said
  mass at 3; at 4, Father
  Prost saw me in the still-wagen, or omnibus, for Brixen. I
  forgot to say that Phillipps agreed with me to meet at
  Caldaron on Thursday. They went off yesterday by Landeck,
  Marenn, &amp;c., for finer scenery. I took my way to see
  the Bishop of Brixen. My principal companions were four
  students at the Inspruck University, going out for their
  vacations. They were two couples of brothers, one called
  Ehrhart, the other Benz, all of Inspruck. The weather was
  become beautiful, and we went through splendid scenery.
  We went over the Brenner mountain, and were going till
  8 o'clock at night. We stopped three times for refreshment:
  at Matraey, Strarzing, and Mittewald. We came to the
  Kreutz Hof&mdash;the Cross Inn&mdash;at Brixen, where I took my
  bed. First, I went to see a pleasing old priest, by name
  Graffanara, who is Domscholasticus here, and whom I saw
  by chance at Inspruck. He told of the Bishop being gone
  to Botzen, and introduced me to the Decanus and Parish
  Priest, to settle for mass to-morrow.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Aug. 28th.
  Great St. Augustine's.&mdash;</span>I was
  up soon after 3, and went to the Pffarr-Kirche, where I said
  mass at 4. The Pffarr treated me with extraordinary respect
  and kindness, and came back with me to my inn,
  where I started again, with the same company, to Botzen,
  in another still-wagen, at 5. We followed the downward
  course of a beautiful torrent, through rocks and mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
  all the way, till we reached Botzen, at 12. I went to the
  Kaiser's Krone, and dined at the <i>table d'hte</i> at 12, next to
  an English gentleman, by name Harley, who was chiefly
  taken up with attacks on cookery out of England. He was
  a man of much information, and gave gloomy accounts of
  the prospect of war with France. His father was an admiral.
  I stayed at home till 4, then went out to the
  Capuchins and then to the Capellani&mdash;the Paroco being out.
  The chief Capellano came back with me to the hotel, and
  waited till the Bishop of Brixen came in. He had been
  out in the country. I was admitted to see him, but quite
  disappointed in my hopes of finding help from him. He
  gave me no signs of zeal, and hardly spoke of England.
  Perhaps it may be for the better some way. No doubt
  disappointments are good for me, and so thank God for this
  one. I afterwards went to the Franciscans, where I found
  real sympathy in one of the fathers, with whom I walked in
  the garden. This was a refreshment after the Bishop. In
  the evening I had a visit from the young Baron Giovanelli,
  whose father has some authority about sending people to see
  Maria Mrl. He could hardly speak Italian, and though
  very civil, did not help me much.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, 29th.&mdash;</span>
  The good Bishop sent me to-day a present
  of a large number of religious prints, with German
  instructions, and showed thus his good will to me; and I
  hope it may be well for my cause. At 7 I said mass in
  the cathedral. At 10 I went in a one-horse carriage to
  Calddaron, or more rightly Caltern. I went directly to see
  Father Capistrano, confessor to Maria Mrl, at a Franciscan
  convent, and then dined at the White Horse inn. At 4,
  according to his direction, I went to the convent of the
  Tertiariae, where Maria Mrl has been for ten years, being
  removed from her father's house by the Bishop, at her own
  request, to avoid being seen by so many people. I waited
  in the convent church till Father Capistrano, who is a tall
  and venerable monk, I suppose of forty-five years old, came
  to call me, with eight or nine other persons, to see the
  <i>estatica</i>. (N.B. Father Capistrano told me that the Bishop
  of Brixen is very deaf, and probably understood nothing of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
  what I talked about, which explains all my disappointment.)
  We went into a small room within her convent, rather
  darkened, where the first sight of Maria on her knees upon
  her bed was most striking. She kneels with her head and
  eyes fixed upwards, her hands joined before her breast, just
  below the chin, and her body leaning forwards in a position
  out of the centre of gravity, in which, ordinarily, no one
  could continue without support. It is most moving to see
  her thus&mdash;I think more so than in any of the other positions
  which she assumed. This was the time when on every
  Thursday she goes through the contemplation of the Agony
  of Our Lord; and so, soon after we came in, she being quite
  unconscious of what goes on around her, began to make
  signs in her throat of earnest emotion, and then, clenching
  her hands together, she dropped her head over them, her
  long, flowing hair being thrown forward over her face, as it
  were accompanying our Lord in the commencement of His
  prayer in the garden; after about five minutes thus, she suddenly
  bends down, placing her face between her knees, as
  when our Lord was prostrate in His agony. After another
  five minutes, she rises, her face again fixed with expression
  of intense earnestness on heaven, and her arms extended
  back downwards, as expressing perfect resignation. After
  five or ten minutes thus, she returns calmly to her original
  attitude of prayer, and thus remained till Father Capistrano
  spoke to her by name, saying a few words almost indistinctly,
  and she instantly returned to herself, reclined back on her
  bed, and, without exertion of moving her limbs, appeared
  simply recumbent, with the bed-cover over her whole body.
  I did not see her rise again, but this is done instantly
  without effort, in the same way. The moment that she was
  thus awakened from the ecstasy, she looked round on us all
  with great good-humour, and smiled; and, being forbidden
  to speak, she made many signs, asking questions of some
  whom she knew before. One priest, il Conte Passi, offered
  her some cotton perfumed from the body of Sta. Maria
  Maddalena di Pazzi; but she would not have it, nor smell it,
  refusing it in a truly pleasant way. I spoke of praying for
  England, and she nodded graciously, but did not take much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
  apparent notice. I suppose she does it about nothing but
  what comes by obedience. If the conversation had a pause,
  she immediately became again absorbed in God till Father
  Capistrano recalled her again. After a proper time, he gave
  us signs to retire; on which she earnestly made signs for a
  cartoon-box full of holy prints to be brought, and she began
  with great earnestness to turn them over, seeming to recollect
  herself very intently. She then gave me two, and afterwards
  another. I was struck when I saw the first was a
  figure of St. George, as she had not heard my name I knew.
  Afterwards, I supposed she might allude only to England,
  as she knew I was English. Soon after, she fell back into
  ecstasy as she lay, and we went away. I walked down to
  the inn with Conte Passi and a priest of the place, who
  visits her nearly every day. I began a letter, when, about 6,
  I was agreeably surprised by seeing Phillipps and his
  party drive up. He and I went to the Franciscan convent,
  but could not see Father Capistrano. Conte Passi and I
  slept in the same room, and into a third bed tumbled some
  one else, I thought, like the ostler, after we were in bed. I
  slept none the worse, and why should I?
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, Aug. 30.&mdash;</span>
  Said mass in the parish church at
  eight. Phillipps after breakfast went and had a long conversation
  with Father Capistrano, who received to-day a
  letter from the Bishop of Trent, to give leave for all of us
  to see the <i>estatica</i>. Phillipps came back with wonderful
  accounts of Father Capistrano's views of the future in the
  Church. He has no bright anticipations. I wrote all the
  morning, letters to Dr. Dllinger, Signor Giovanelli, and
  Mr. LeSage Ten Broek. We dined at 1. At 2 we all went
  to the convent church, where, as yesterday, P. Capistrano
  came to take us to la Mrl. Three o'clock, being the time
  of Our Lord's death, this is the subject of her contemplation
  at that time every Friday. Soon after we came in,
  from the attitude of prayer in which we found her as yesterday;
  she again clasped her hands, and, looking up with an
  expression of suffering, she continued for some time to make
  a sort of sobbing noise, and stertation, as I have seen people
  dying of apoplexy; this grew more painful till, exactly at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
  three, she dropped her head forward, and her hands yet
  clasped hung down before her and so she remained quite
  motionless, still leaning forward beyond the perpendicular,
  "<i>inclinato capite emisit spiritum</i>." This continued till, at
  one of those almost inaudible suggestions of the confessor,
  she fell back on the bed, as yesterday, but still in ecstasy,
  and extended her hands in the form of a crucifix. The
  fingers were guttered over the palm of the hands, but yet
  we saw plainly in the palm the sacred stigma. I saw it
  yesterday outside both her hands, quite plainly, as she was
  distributing the prints. The marks are not as of an open
  wound, but red cicatrices like those represented in pictures
  of Our Saviour when risen from the dead. Father Capistrano
  said that she eats a little bread and fruit occasionally,
  not every day; she communicates three or four times
  a week; she sleeps generally in the night, I understood,
  but her spirit still continues in a less degree of contemplation.
  She had a younger sister with her in the convent, to
  wait on her. The Emperor allows her 400 florins a year.
  On more solemn feasts, the ecstasy is more intense, and she
  then appears for a time raised above the bed, touching it
  only with the tips of her feet. The priest whom I saw
  yesterday says that he has himself passed his hand at those
  times under her knees without touching them. It is a rule
  that no money is given by visitors either to her or the convent.
  We went away, and prepared for our departure
  about 4. I engaged a small one-horse carriage to go to
  <i>Egna</i> in Italian, in German <i>Neumarkt</i>, intending to see
  the <i>Addolorata</i>, and to meet the Phillippses again at Venice.
  I began to have a distaste to the rude-looking driver, at the
  first sight, still more, when I found that the carriage belonged
  to a priest who had come from Egna this morning. I made
  it straight for time by taking him with me. A second nuisance
  was, finding, when I set off, that Phillipps had to go
  to the same place, as his first stage towards Trent. In a
  narrow road down the hill, out of Caldaro, we met an
  immense number of carts, loaded with hay, and drawn by
  oxen, from eighty to a hundred, which was a good delay, and
  Phillipps's carriage got terribly scratched in passing one. At
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
  Egna, I put up at the Krono. I went out to see a priest,
  who took me to the Franciscans about saying mass tomorrow.
  I preached England.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, Aug. 31.&mdash;</span>
  I fell into the hands of the sulky
  driver of yesterday, who undertook to find me a mule to go
  over the mountains at once to Capriana, but he came last
  night to say none was to be found; I heard before that
  there was danger of this in harvest time. I therefore first
  said mass at the Franciscans', at 3 o'clock, doubtful whether
  it was not uncanonically early, and at 4 went with my friend
  driving me, with one horse on the left of the pole, to Cavallesi,
  a small town in the mountains, which we reached at 8
  o'clock. There I saw the physician of Dominica Lazzari,
  whom Count Passi told me to go to. He was very civil,
  and recommended me a pleasant guide, who at 9 set off,
  walking by the pony which I rode to Cavallesi. The day
  was beautiful, and not too hot for me, though it was for him
  on foot. It was a most interesting, picturesque ride of 2
  hours, reminding me of my Sicilian and other rides long
  since, and I was surprised how this seemed to agree with me
  now. Capriana is a little very poor village, occupying a
  spot on an open space, high among the mountains. The very
  first cottage in the body of the town, and one of the
  poorest, is where this wonderful being spends her suffering
  days. The Medico Yoris had written me a note to the
  primissario, or second priest to the curate, who is Dominica's
  confessor, who might have helped me about seeing her;
  but he was not at home, so we went to the house at once.
  The door of the little place, a part of a building, where
  Dominica lives with her sister, was locked. The sister was
  out. I heard her groaning slightly at every breath. She
  made something of an answer when my guide knocked.
  He went to seek her sister, and came back saying that she
  begged us to delay a little, as others had been with her, and
  she was much fatigued. So we went to the Osteria, and got
  the best they could give, which was a <i>brodo d'acqua</i>, in English,
  I fancy, tea-kettle broth. This shows that the place is
  not chosen for its riches to be honoured by God with His
  wonders. After this pause we returned to the little house,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
  which has a Tyrolese roof overhanging, and a little gallery
  outside her door. The sister, who is married and has her
  children about her, took us in, and in an inner room we saw
  the Addolorata in her bed. Her appearance naturally will
  not have been interesting, like that of Maria Mrl, but
  rather of an ordinary young countrywoman, of low stature,
  like her sister. She has ordinarily the appearance of great
  pain and suffering; but when I spoke to her about England,
  she lifted her eyes and moved her hands in a way
  more earnest than <i>l'estatica</i>, and showed great feeling at
  the thought of its conversion. Now for her appearance:
  her face was almost all covered with clotted blood, which
  flowed, I suppose, yesterday morning, for so it does every
  Friday, from the punctures as of thorns on her brow. These
  were not, as I expected, irregularly placed as by a crown of
  thorns made at hazard, but they formed a line close together
  on the forehead, and do not go round the head to the back
  part. Her legs were gathered up as if the sinews were contracted;
  her body, the doctor told me, is all covered with sores,
  which, the more that is done to cure, the worse they grow.
  She keeps her hands clenched before her heart, and groans
  slightly with every breath. On her hands were seen stigmata,
  much more marked than Maria Mrl, like fresh
  wounds by a nail passing through and sinking into the flesh.
  Her sister said the same was the case with her side and feet.
  I only spoke to her a little about England, and was delighted
  at her manner then, which shows how superior she is to her
  pains. It seems to distress her to be too near her, and as I
  have learned since it does. She is always hot; her sister
  was fanning her all the time, and in the depth of winter
  it is the same thing, when snow drives into her room. She
  also gives her prints; she made her sister show her prints
  out of a little case, and when she has chosen them she kisses
  them and gives them to each with great kindness. There
  were a young man and woman there, who offered money for
  them to her sister, but she will take nothing. The sight of
  her is not at first so striking and pleasing as of la Mrl, but
  the remembrance is more impressive. It seems a state more
  meritorious, more humble. It is more poor, and patient.

  Having been delayed so long, I could not get to Cavallesi till
  3; the sulky face of the driver betokened no good for my
  return; the horse, too, he said was ill, and in fine, he
  brought me to Egna just too late for the still-wagen to
  Lavorno, and I was not so patient as I ought to have been
  after seeing that example, but I was helped by it a little. I
  had to take a carriage for myself and the same miserable
  driver, who was going to sleep all the way, and grunted at
  me once when I awoke him. I got to a nice inn at Lavorno,
  the white house again.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, Sept. 1.&mdash;</span>
  I started at 5 by a still-wagen for
  Trent, all alone in it. I came to the Rose Inn, and waited
  to say mass at the Church di S. Maria Maggiora, where
  the Council of Trent was held, and prayed, as usual
  on Sundays, for the gift of Faith, which was appropriate
  here. The church is quite uninteresting in appearance.
  I breakfasted at a cafe, and went about my
  way of travelling; then at  to 11 went and heard the end
  of a high mass. I thought to be in time for all. After it I
  was very happy in getting myself introduced to the Bishop,
  who was extremely agreeable, and said he prayed daily for
  England, and promised to recommend it to Maria la Mrl,
  and to all the clergy. I left, as if I need take no more
  trouble about Trent. I went to the Rosa, and stayed there
  quiet till dinner at 12, and then till 4, writing my long
  days of late in the Journal. At 4, I got into a carriage
  carrying four inside to Roveredo, where I got to the Corona,
  and went to bed at 8 or 9.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, Sept. 2.&mdash;</span>I
  set off soon after 3 with an old
  <i>vetturino</i>, who rather displeased me last night in making
  his bargain, by his flattering way; but I found him a nice
  old man, and very civil. We got to Bosketto, on the banks
  of the Adige (which indeed we followed all day), at 7. I
  said mass and breakfasted. Then we went on to dine at a
  single house, called Ospitaletto. We stayed from 12 to 2; I
  wrote two letters. We then started and got to Verona at
  4, to the Hotel di Londra. I took a <i>laquais de place</i>, and
  walked to Count Persico's house. I was sorry to find him
  in the country. Then to the Jesuit Noviciate, where I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
  thought I might possibly find Connolly. The Superior
  showed me Padre Odescalchi's room, where he passed his
  noviciate. I recommended myself to his prayers. I had
  been reading on the road his memoirs, given me at Louvain.
  The Superior promised to recommend England. I went
  then to the cathedral, and the Bishop being out, I saw the
  Vicario, who kindly promised to speak for me to the
  Bishop. I then went into the cathedral, where there was a
  brilliant illumination, and a most solemn benediction, and
  then a litany before the altar of the Blessed Virgin, which
  reminded me of the holy litanies of Rome. I have seen
  nothing like this on the Continent, nor have I seen a town
  so full of respectable clergy in every part. Came home and
  to bed at 8.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Sept. 3rd.&mdash;</span>Started
  at 4 with my new <i>vetturino</i>,
  who cheated me as usual, but was civil. It rained almost
  all day. I said mass at a place called Montebello, and got
  to Vicenza to dine at 11. Then started for Padua with a
  new <i>vetturino</i>, and had for company an old and a young
  Roman priest. The old one was Bighi, a well-known professor,
  who taught Dr. Wiseman and S. Sharples, &amp;c., and
  was full of kindness to me. I talked myself almost hoarse
  with him. They stopped at Padua. I went on railroad to
  Venice. I sat by a priest of Illyricum of the <i>scuole pie</i> of
  St. Joseph Calasanctius; but what was wonderful was my
  being in the midst of Mrs. Neville and her family, whom
  Mrs. Rio desired me to see, coming back from a visit to
  Vicenza. We kept together all across the Sayburne, and
  made a great acquaintance. I got into a gondola, and had
  to go a great round to put down another young man, who
  had already engaged it. I had a great battle about my
  fare, and for a wonder I conquered. I waited a little,
  having my chocolate, when Phillipps and all came in, and
  we made a happy meeting, giving an account of our respective
  travels.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Sept. 4th.&mdash;</span>I
  went at 7 to say mass at San
  Marco, but was obliged to wait till 8, as they are very
  strict here not to allow a priest to mass without leave from
  the Patriarch, except the first day, when, as to me, leave
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
  is given. I breakfasted at a cafe, then went with Phillipps
  to St. Georgio dei Greci, and heard a high mass of the
  schismatic Greeks, of whom there is a colony at Venice;
  the occasion was the octave of the Assumption, old style.
  The mass was all celebrated behind a close screen; which is
  open part of the time, but not during the most solemn part.
  After the consecration, the host and chalice are carried outside
  this screen in procession, and presented for adoration;
  one man before us was making his prostrations all the
  time. The priests had chasubles, hanging evenly all
  round to near the ankles; they lifted them to use their
  hands; there is no musical instrument, but singing all the
  time. I then went to the Cancellaria to get my licence to
  say mass, and then to Mrs. Neville at the Corte dell' Albero.
  She soon after took me to the Armenian College, where the
  examinations were just finished. There are eighteen scholars,
  with two priests over them, in an old grand palace of
  a ruined family of Pesaro. The <i>vicario</i> and several others
  from the island were there. We talked much about England.
  I came to dinner at the Tavola, returned at 4,
  Then we went to the Island of St. Lazzaro, to see Padre
  Pasquale and the Archbishop Sutrio Somal (as the name
  sounds), great friends of Phillipps at Rome in 1831, and of
  mine, too. When we came back. I went in a gondola to
  Mrs. Neville, and back to tea.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Sept. 5.&mdash;</span>This
  being the feast of St. Lorenzo
  Giustiniani, I went out at 6 to find the church where
  his body is laid. He died in the very hotel where we are.
  The church I went to in a gondola in rain to St. Pietro
  at Castello&mdash;the ancient patriarchal church&mdash;and said mass
  at the high altar, where he lies. I walked back in rain,
  without umbrella, as I lost mine yesterday. I bought
  another. At 12, Padre Raffaelle, an Armenian priest, Mrs.
  Neville's confessor, to whom she introduced me yesterday,
  called and took me to the patriarch, Cardinal Monico, who
  received most graciously my propositions for England. I
  am to call again with the Phillippses on Saturday, and get
  something more exactly settled about the prayers; we then
  went across the Great Canal to the Del Redentore, where
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
  is a convent of eighty Capuchins. The church is reckoned
  a <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of Palladio, built <i>ex voto</i> by the Republic, after
  a plague. We saw the guardian, who is also provincial; he
  learned our want, and promised for his own house and ten
  others of the province. I came back to dinner. A Greek
  priest whom Phillipps got acquainted with the other day,
  came to dine with us, and sat till 9. His conversation was
  very interesting as showing the ideas of the Greeks about
  the Roman Church, and their doctrines on many points
  varying from ours. What a terrible evil is that of separation
  of nearly half of Christendom! The greater reasons to
  hasten the reunion of England, that we may draw the
  others.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, Sept. 6.&mdash;</span>The
  two Neville boys came with me to
  St. Marco, and served my mass, as their mother had desired.
  After breakfast, I called on Mrs. Neville, who was not up,
  then went to Palazzo Pasaro, to Padre Raffaelle. He came
  with me first to the Franciscans; the guardian promised for
  his house of fifty, and for three or four at some distance
  from him. Then to the Dominicans, who are fifteen, a new
  establishment a year old. Then to the Jesuits, who are
  eight in number, only this summer returned to their old
  church, which is one of the most remarkable for its ornaments
  in Venice, white marble inlaid with black. I
  remembered it well from twenty-six years ago. The superior,
  Padre Ferrario, is going to Rome to-morrow, and promised
  to see about my matters there with Cardinal Acton
  and the general of the Jesuits. I came home in haste, and
  found Phillipps, and Mrs. Neville and her friends with her,
  gone to St. Marco, where we followed them to see the
  treasury&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the inestimably rich treasures brought by
  Doge Dandolo from Constantinople, just before it was taken
  by the Turks. The chief thing is an antependium and a
  reredos of massive gold, with splendid pearls and enamels.
  Mrs. Neville took us to the Convent of the Visitation,
  where is preserved the heart of St. Francis of Sales, which
  was brought from France when the Revolution drove off all
  religious. They could not show this relic; but promised
  prayers, and to write to other houses. There were there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
  forty nuns. Back to dinner at the <i>table d'hte</i>. After
  dinner we went all together to see the only large Gothic
  church in Venice, called St. &mdash;&mdash; di Frari, which is the
  Venetian for Frati; it used to be the Franciscan church,
  and their house is turned into a public Archivium.
  Phillipps said they deserved it for having such a palace.
  The church is a fine one, and has some good morsels;
  but what is most startling, or rather glaring, is the immense
  marble monument to Canova&mdash;a pyramid, with a heathen
  procession into it. His heart is here. His right hand in
  an urn at the Arcadinia. We tried at St. Sitorstro (Silvestro)
  to assist at the 40 <i>ore</i>, but all was over. We came
  back by a fine star light, and went to St. Marco, where we
  had ices at Floriano's <i>caf</i>, and heard military music.
  Canonico Pio Bighi, and his young companion Don Giovanni
  Moneti, joined us, <i>ad cor. sat.</i> We came home at 9.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sept. 7th.&mdash;</span>Said
  mass at St. Marco, on the altar where the
  miraculous picture of Our Lady is, by St. Luke. The Greek
  priest told us there existed seventy-five of them. I went at
  8 to the Jesuits, to give a letter for Cardinal Acton, about
  indulgences for prayers for England, to Padre Ferrarrio, the
  Superior, who sets off to-day for Rome. I found Mrs.
  Neville and Father Raffaelle talking to him. The latter
  kindly went around with me to-day again. We went first
  to the Institute of St. Dorothea, founded lately by Conte
  Passi and his brother, which we desired to see. The Superioress
  was out, but another made excellent promises.&mdash;15
  nuns. Then to St. Lucia, to the Sisters of Charity, and
  another house dependent on them. In the latter was an
  Armenian lady who spoke English, having been six years at
  Hammersmith Convent. The Superioress of the chief house
  spoke of Gentili with great respect; she knew him when she
  was at the house at Verona. She promised me for thirteen
  houses under her authority. Then we went past the Jesuits
  to a house of Reformed Franciscans (Zoccolanti). St. Michele
  di Marano. Promised for three houses as large as this,
  about twenty-six, and many more smaller. This is where
  Gregory XVI. was educated, made his novitiate, and was
  Superior. We saw the outside of his room; the key could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
  not be got. We got back at 12. I went with Phillipps
  to the Cardinal Patriarch, as appointed before. I gave him
  the prayer for England which I gave to Padre Ferrario,
  and he promised to speak with him also. Thence to the
  Accademia, where for two hours we looked at the pictures
  and statues. It did not greatly answer me. Thence left our
  cards on the Duc de Levis, who, with his master the Due de
  Bordeaux, is at the Albergo Reale. Then dined. Another
  <i>maigre</i>. After I did not go out with them, as I had office
  to say. At 7 we had a party to tea&mdash;the Greek priest,
  with Mrs. Neville and three children. They stayed till
  past 11.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, Sept. 8. Nativity of Blessed Virgin.&mdash;</span>I said
  mass at S. Marco. We went to the high Armenian mass
  at S. Lazzaro at 10. We were a little late. After it we
  stayed there with our friends the fathers till vespers and
  benediction, at 3. And after that, dinner at 4. Mrs.
  Neville and family were there too. It was an interesting
  day for seeing and conversing. I saw, in the visitors' book,
  my name under Lefevre's, written by him July, 1820. We
  sat in the cloister, with the old Archbishop, &amp;c., till twilight.
  He made us presents of many handsome books
  printed there. We came back to S. Marco, and sat to
  hear the band, &amp;c. On coming home, at 7, we were in
  great demand with cards and notes, left by the Duc de
  Levis, to invite us to the Duc de Bordeaux's (Comte de
  Chombard) salon at 7. We were all thrown back by
  Phillipps having no dresses to go in. So we had to keep
  easy at home.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, Sept. 9.&mdash;</span>Mass
  at the cathedral (S. Marco).
  P. Raffaele and the Greek priest came to breakfast. At
  10 I had a visit from the Superioress of the Institute of Sta.
  Dorothea and a companion. At 10 we went to visit the
  Duc de Bordeaux, who gave us a quarter of an hour's most
  affable conversation, spoke with great kindness of his reception
  in England, and asked after Dr. Wiseman, &amp;c. His
  confessor, the Abb Trlouquet, was introduced to us, and
  came in our gondola to Mrs. Neville, of whom we took
  leave. Mr. Trlouquet promised to engage the French royal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
  family in prayers for England. He said, the Duc de Bordeaux
  had spoken of my asking him at Oscott. We went
  then to S. Tommaso, where I left the Phillippses and went
  to the banker, Holme, who is Armenian consul. Then
  back to S. Tommaso, where I found them looking at an
  extraordinary collection of relics made by a priest, who
  devoted himself to the work when all things were in confusion
  in the revolution. He gave the collection to the church,
  on condition of their being open to the public for veneration.
  The chief relic is some of the blood of Our Lord, in a beautiful
  gold or gilt reliquary. I found there Monsignor Arfi,
  the Pope's Caudatario, and invited for England. I then
  went to Padre Raffaele, at the college, and went with him
  to see the two brothers, priests Cavanis, founders of an
  excellent institute of <i>Scuole di Carit</i>. They are in a poor
  house, with a few companions; one of them complained
  that no one helped them; but they are like their patron
  S. Joseph Calasanctius, losing ground in old age, but with
  hope of better things. P. Raffaele, who has indeed been an
  angel to me in Venice, came with me to the inn where
  they were at dinner. At 4 we left Venice, with pleasant
  remembrances. We crossed the lagune in a procession of
  boats, and got into the railway carriage, which took us to
  Padua about 7. At the Stella d'Oro I went out to try to
  find the Bishop; but he was not in town.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Sept, 10.&mdash;</span>I
  went to St. Antony's church at
  7 to say mass. Before going I met Dr. Roskell, of Manchester,
  just come with a Manchester party on a rapid tour.
  I could not have the altar of St. Antony, which seems
  always occupied. I spoke to the Superior of the house of
  Conventual Franciscans attached to the church, 50 in
  number, who promised to recommend my cause. I came
  back in a little carriage with Phillipps. We started at 9
  for Verona, dined at Vicenza; then I took a carriage and
  called on the Bishop, Monsignor Capellari, a good old man,
  who received me graciously. We stopped in going out of
  Vicenza to see Palladio's Olympic Theatre, built to act the
  OEdipus Tyrannus in 1585. This pretends to nothing but
  paganism. We reached Verona at 7. I went out to see
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
  the Bishop, who was quite gracious; he begins his retreat
  with his clergy to-morrow, and promised to begin then and
  recommend England. I then called at Conte Persico's, who
  is in town, but was just gone to the theatre. Home, and to
  bed at 9.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Sept. 11.&mdash;</span>Up
  soon after 5, and at 7 said
  mass in St. Anastasius, a large church close to the hotel.
  Soon after Conte Persico came to return my visit, and sat
  a good while with me, then with the Phillippses, to whom
  I introduced him. He is grown very old, being now 67.
  He said he was married two years after I had seen him before,
  and was now by accident in town with his wife. I
  thought him very like his old father. At 10 we went in a
  carriage to see the tombs of the Scaligeri, formerly tyrants
  of Verona, fine Gothic structure; then the Amphitheatre,
  and the church of St. Zenone, where I saw the image of the
  saint again which I before laughed at, as a thing so to be
  treated, in 1820. I then called at Conte Persico's, and saw
  his lady. At 12 we set off for Dezenzano, a beautiful spot
  at the town end of the Lake di Garda. We arrived at 6,
  and had a pleasant evening in a little room of the Albergo
  Imperiale, looking over the lake. I wrote to Mrs. Neville
  and Abb de Baudry.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, Sept. 12.&mdash;</span>There
  was rain in the night, leaving
  us a fine day without dust. I said mass at 6 in the parish
  church. We went to dine at the Duc Torri, at Brescia. I
  went to see the Bishop, who received me very courteously.
  There I met a Philippine lay-brother, who introduced me to
  the church of his order, Sta. Maria della Pace, then to five
  or six of the fathers sitting together. I had a fine opportunity
  of recommending England. They are the only religious
  house in Brescia (of men at least). After dinner at 3 we
  set off for Bergamo, when we came to Albergo Reale at 9
  o'clock. I got up to my knees in a stream near the road at
  the wet stage, but hope no harm from it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, Sept. 13.&mdash;</span>Anniversary
  of my first coming
  abroad, 1819. I got up soon after 5, said mass in a church
  opposite the inn, breakfasted at a caf, then walked up the
  beautiful road to the high town called the <i>Citt</i>, where our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
  inn was is the borga. Between them there are about
  36,000. In the <i>Citt</i> I met a priest, by name Giuseppe
  Caffi, belonging to the collegiate church, who, when I asked
  him for Count Papi, volunteered to be my guide altogether.
  He showed me the cathedral, his own church, Sta. Maria,
  and a little convent church, Church of the Benedictine
  Nuns, beautifully gilt. He also went with me to the Bishop,
  who gave me one of the best receptions. By the same good
  hap as at Verona, the priests were in retreat. He introduced
  me to the Abbate Vittadini, conductor of the retreat,
  who promised to speak of England to the clergy. He was
  already full of zeal for it; he knew a good deal of the
  state of things with us. When I wrote my name, he knew
  it well, and it had a good effect. I went with Abb Caffi to
  the palace of Count Papi; all were away. He came with
  us to the hotel, and soon we started for Milan. We arrived
  at 3, and found rooms in the best hotel (de la Ville). <i>Tables
  d'hte</i> at 5. I said office, and just got time to look in the
  cathedral before dinner, and again after we all went. It
  was beyond my recollections of old. I admired the ceiling,
  which seemed all beautiful openwork; I did not remember
  this. It seemed to be only painted so. How I remember
  Lord Kinnaird taking my mother to it. We tried two
  other churches to find Benediction in vain. Then I went
  with Phillipps to a bookseller's.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, Sept. 14.&mdash;</span>Up
  at 5. I went to say mass at
  the cathedral, and finding that the Roman rite is not
  allowed in the church alone, I was in the happy necessity of
  celebrating in the chapel of St. Charles, in the crypt, which
  is almost reserved for strangers. I waited over two masses.
  After breakfast we had a visit from Count Mellerio,
  Rosinini's great friend. Phillipps and I went with him to
  his palace, and saw Abbate Polidori, who lives there. Mrs.
  Ambrose came with the carriage to pick us up, and I went
  to the Church of St. Celso, and to the great hospital fitted up
  for 3,000 patients; then to vespers at the Duomo, and at 3
  to dine with Count Mellerio. I sat near Polidori. Before
  we parted he and Signer Mercati seemed gained for England.
  At 6 we went to a Benediction at the Duomo, only of relics
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
  of the Passion, and not very solemn. This was by occasion
  of the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross to-day. I then
  went to the Archbishop's palace to find the Grand Vicar, to
  get leave for confessions to-morrow, and without expecting
  it saw the Cardinal himself instead. As Count Mellerio was
  to prepare my way to-morrow, I did not speak of England.
  When I got home I found Mellerio at the inn, bringing a
  permission from the Grand Vicar. To bed after 10. I have
  got unwell to-day in the inside,&mdash;between yesterday's <i>maigre</i>
  and the fruit, I suppose.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, Sept. 15.&mdash;</span>We
  went together this morning to
  the old basilica of St. Ambrose, where I said mass at the
  saint's tomb, in the crypt. The Phillippses received communion.
  Then we saw the splendid covering of the altar
  above, in the church. It is exposed only on three days at
  mass&mdash;St. Ambrose, SS. Gervase and Protase, and Corpus
  Christi. SS. Gervase and Protase's relics are there, with St.
  Ambrose's. This altar cost to a bishop who gave it, 80,000
  sequins of gold, about the year 1000. I spoke to the
  Directeur du Sminaire de Chamberry, who was there, and
  he promised to speak of England. We went home to
  breakfast at 10. Assisted at high mass in the Duomo
  again; not so solemn as yesterday. The procession of the
  Blessed Sacrament before it did not please me much. After
  high mass I went to call on the Cardinal again. I was not
  so much disappointed as in the case of the Bishop of <i>Brixen</i>,
  for I had heard nothing promising about this interview as
  in the other cases; but I felt as one defeated when I went
  away. I went to the Piazza del Castello to see the Contessa
  del Verme and her sister, English people, converts to whom
  Abbate Vittadini, at Bergamo, recommended me. Her
  sister, Miss Mary Webster, is just about entering the order
  of the Visitation here. The Count came in just when I was
  gone out, and followed me to S. Alessandro, of the Barnabites,
  which he had heard me ask for as I left his house. I
  brought him to see Phillipps. We dined at 3, and at 4
  went to the Arena, or Amphitheatre, where there was a grand
  <i>spettacolo nautico e pirotecnico.</i> The arena was full of
  water, and we had five races of boats, three of men, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
  women, and one of boys rowing; then a procession of two
  great illuminated galleys filled with musicians; then what
  struck me most, as most new to me, the ascent of fifty
  fine balloons; then of one very large one; then a splendid
  display of fireworks, ending as often with an illuminated
  palace, with an inscription <i>alle scienze, alle letters, alle arti</i>,
  as the spectacle was in honour of the Sixth Italian Scientific
  Congress, now being held here. We got home at  to 9; I
  almost well again.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, September 16.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at St. Fidele, formerly
  one of the three Jesuit churches. At 8 we set off
  in a carriage to see the Certosa of Pavia. We got to it at
  10, and were two hours examining its beautiful details.
  Women are now forbidden entrance into the choir, and so
  Mrs. Ambrose had to stay in the body of the church, while
  we, with other people who had come to see it, saw the rich
  high altar and many of the finest things. There are not many
  precious stones, like rubies, emeralds, &amp;c., but a profusion of
  altar-fronts of Pietra-dura, beautiful <i>alto relievos</i> in marble,
  and many fine pictures. The convent is but lately reinhabited.
  Count Mellerio was the means of replacing monks
  there. They are all French. We saw the Prior, who knew
  Michael MacMahon. He promised to recommend England
  not only here, but by letter in other houses. We dined at
  an inn half a mile from the church, called Albergo della
  Certosa, and came back to Milan by 5. I got off near the
  Contrada S. Maria Falconeria, to call at a convent of Sisters
  of Charity of the same order as those of Sta. Lucia, at Venice.
  I saw the Superioress. Then I went to the Count del Verme's
  palace. La Contessa was confined this morning. I saw
  Miss Webster, who spoke about two English girls whom they
  are instructing, wishing me to receive the confession of one
  who cannot speak Italian. I went out with the priest who
  instructs them, Don Gaetano Fumagalli, to see them. We
  first went to the convent of the Salesiani, 54 nuns (visitation),
  into which Miss Webster is about to enter, and though the
  time was past, we saw the mistress of novices through the
  grate, who was very gracious about England. Then we
  went to a high story in a house where these girls lodge, paid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
  for by the Cardinal. After coming home I went, on an invitation
  obtained by the Conte del Verme, to a grand
  assembly and concert at the Accademia, or the <i>Nobil Societ</i>.
  The gayest rooms I have seen a long time. I came home
  soon after ten, for I knew nobody there, and was almost the
  only priest I saw; certainly the only one in a cassock.

<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, September 17.&mdash;</span>Mass
  at St. Fidele. At 8
  Count Mellerio came, and we started for his villa at Gernetto,
  beyond Monza. He took Mrs. A. and Amb., and I and
  a boy went in our carriage, with four vetturino horses.
  We stopped at Monza to see the glorious relic of the Iron
  Crown given by the Empress Helena to Constantine, in
  which is inserted, as a ring of iron within a larger ring of
  gold, one of the nails of Our Lord's crucifixion beat out into
  that form. It has crowned from thirty to forty kings of
  Italy. Among them, Napoleon last but one. Other grand
  relics of the Passion are with it, two thorns, and a piece of
  the sponge. Other relics are in the sacristy. This is kept
  over an altar within rich doors. The Canonico, who was
  with us in the church, promised to recommend England.
  We went on to the palace of the Archduke, surrounded by
  a park fifteen miles round, dressed like an English park, a
  noble palace. Then on to Gernetto, where we were for two
  or three hours before dinner walking gaily with the Count
  round his beautiful grounds. The villa is very handsome.
  Two priests of the neighbourhood dined with us at 3. One
  told me that Count Mellerio is one of the richest, or rather
  the richest nobleman in Milan,&mdash;about 15,000 a year of our
  money. He is alone, having lost his wife and four children.
  He came back with us to our hotel, where I found Count
  del Verme to tell me that the confession of the girls was
  put off. They have been left here by their mother. Their
  parents, &mdash;&mdash; and Ann Carraway, live at Newcastle-under-Lyne.
  Their grandfather and mother, James and Mary
  Freakley, at Cheapside, Handley. I went with the Count
  to the assembly of the learned men who are now met in
  Milan,&mdash;not so smart as yesterday, but very numerous. Then
  to a caf, to read news about the effects of O'Connell's
  liberation.

<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, September 18.&mdash;</span>I
  went with Phillippses to
  the Duomo to say mass for them at St. Charles's tomb, but
  I found it occupied, and so I went to San Fidele again,
  came back to breakfast, and saw Conte Mellerio, who had
  called. Then went with them to the Brera, where I went
  quickly through the gallery, and left them, taking the carriage
  to go to the hospital of the Fate-bene Fratelli, which
  is a fine establishment for 100 sick. The Vicario, whom I
  saw, promised to recommend England to the Provincial, who
  is here, and through him to the thirty brothers here, and
  five houses in Lombardy&mdash;<i>vento</i>. Then I went to the bank.
  Dined at 1, and at 2 we started with a Swiss <i>voiturier</i>,
  whom we had engaged to take us to Geneva. We passed
  the beautiful triumphal arch, L'Arco della Pace, reckoned
  the finest in the world, ancient and modern. We got to
  sleep at a nice inn, in a place called Casiua buon Jesu. I
  wrote a letter to Dr. Wiseman.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, September 19. San Januarius.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass
  at the little oratory of the village. There is mass here only
  on Sundays generally, but the bell rung three times for my
  mass, and we had a full chapel. This chapel not very neat;
  it seemed used for a school-room. We started at  past 7,
  and reached Avona at 12 to dine. How I was struck with
  the remembrance of the last time in this place with my
  father and mother, after coming in a boat with Dr. Wilson
  from Bavino. The inn is a fine new house since then. We
  saw a steamboat pass, which plies daily the whole length of
  the lake. I missed going to St. Charles's statue and the
  seminary near it, belonging to the diocese of Novara, where
  I should have liked to go to preach England. After dinner
  we started and went round to Strass, where we stopped and
  went up the mountain's side to see Rosmini's Novitiate,
  which overlooks the village. It is a large house, without
  beauty or character, unhappily. We knew we should not
  find Rosinini, who is at Roveredo. We saw Segnini and
  two other priests, Paoli and Gagliardi. They have thirty
  novices. The situation is beautiful. The ground belonged
  before to Madame Bolognaro, who has a large house in the
  town, where, while we were at the convent, the Bishop of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
  Novara came. I would not have failed to ask an audience
  had I been alone, but I made the priests promise to speak
  to him of England. We took a boat to go to the Isola
  Bella, to see the palace and gardens on our way to Bavino,
  the carriage going on there by itself. It was almost dark
  when we got there, and we could only see the suite of grand
  rooms and pictures, and the chapel with the old family
  tombs brought from Milan, by candlelight. <i>Mem</i>. A room
  of rockwork underneath the chief suite, where Bonaparte
  dined, and the bedroom he slept in. The whole of this
  grandeur is made worse than worthless by the indecent
  statues and pictures which are all about the place. We got
  to Bavino at 8; a nice new inn.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, Sept. 20.&mdash;</span>Ember
  Day, but no fast for me!
  I got to say mass at 4, and we started at 6 to ascend the
  Simplon. The day was beautiful. We got to Domodossola
  at 11. We went up the beautiful road to the Monte
  Calvario, of which Gentili has made me think so much,
  first having taken a look at their college in the town, where
  there are 19 boarders and more than 200 out-students. At
  the Calvary two priests received us kindly. Along the
  road to it are chapels with the stations represented in groups
  of figures as large as life, well executed; only two or three
  are complete. The situation here again is admirable. The
  house and church not remarkable. I was well received for
  England. Coming down, which I did after the rest, I
  visited a pretty Capuchin convent, half-way up, of fifteen
  friars, and had a good reception (promise to write to the
  other houses). After dinner at 2 we set off for Simplon,
  which we reached after 8. The <i>voiturier</i> (coachman), to spare
  his horses, put us on post-horses at his own expense. The
  road on the Piedmontese side is sadly dilapidated. It was
  broken down (by water, as it seems) six years ago, and the
  King of Sardinia will not have his part repaired, to make
  people go by Mount Cenis and Turin. Put up at the
  Simplon Inn.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, Sept. 21. St. Matthew.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at 7,
  spoke to the cur after, who promised for England. We
  started at 8; we still had two hours going up the hill.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
  About the summit is the Hospice de St. Bernard, begun by
  Bonaparte. I remember it in an unfinished state. It now
  contains four or five priests, and some brothers. We stopped
  and saw the Prior, M. Barras, who promised kindly to
  recommend England to the mother house. Phillipps bought
  a puppy of the famous breed, three months old, who was
  added to our company in the carriage. We reached Brigy
  between 12 and 1. I went out before dinner, and saw the
  Superior of the Jesuits' College here, who is a nice old man,
  and received us very kindly. I hurried away quickly,
  thinking to return again after dinner, but the dinner was
  long after time, and we had at once to set off for Turtinan,
  which we reached at 6. We went out before tea to see a
  waterfall: it was a dark, wet walk, for rain was beginning.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, Sept. 22.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at 5. Soon after 6 we
  set off for Sion. Arrived at 10, and found a grand military
  pontifical high mass begun in the cathedral. I never heard
  drums and cannon and the word of command in a mass
  before. The music was not military, but noisy figured. The
  occasion of the solemn mass was the feast of St. Maurice,
  patron of the Valais. After mass the Bishop walked with
  a great procession about the town, with a feretrum, with
  relics of St. Maurice. The chief part are at the town of the
  name, which we are to pass to-morrow. The procession had
  an excellent effect. I went then to the Jesuits' College, and
  spoke to the Rector, who told me the first I had heard of the
  attempt at revolution in the month of May here, which was
  defeated in a gallant style by the inhabitants of the Valais
  arming to the number of 10,000, from a population of
  70,000, under an old French officer, <i>i.e.</i>, a Swiss, trained in
  the French army, who repelled the party of the Jeune
  Suisse, who otherwise would have overturned religious
  order, and perhaps, as he said, have massacred all the religious.
  Young Bodenham was in their house when the
  danger threatened. The Rector was very kind, but did not
  promise much. I went then to dine at a <i>table d'hte</i>, but
  soon got off, and went to the Bishop lately consecrated, who
  came from table to speak with me. He was educated at the
  Collegio Germanico; knew Baldacconi and Father Daniel.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
  He promised his help. I then went to a Capuchin convent
  outside the town. The guardian, a young man, was rather
  cold, but said meanwhile that he always prayed for England,
  as ordered in the Confrrie de l'Immacul Coeur. Then
  to a convent of Ursulines, close to the Bishop's; eleven nuns
  (well received); then in a hurry to an hospital outside the
  town on the other side, with eight nuns. The director gave
  me one of my most favourable receptions, and promised that
  the nuns should change their day of communion from Friday
  to Thursday to meet my wishes. We set off at 2 for Martigny,
  which we reached at 5. It has a different look from
  1819, the year after the inundation. I called on the cur,
  who is one of the monks of Grand St. Bernard, with the white
  linen scapular to represent the surplice, which they always
  wear as canons regular of St. Augustine, to which they
  belong. He was very good about England. From thence, I
  went to an hospital kept by six French nuns, to receive poor
  travellers, female St. Bernardites. The Superioress was very
  agreeable and zealous. They are going directly to France to
  make their retreat with 600 other nuns, assembled under
  the Bishop of Belley. She promised to get him to recommend
  it to them all. I came back to tea after a happy,
  successful day (Htel de la Cigne). Alpine strawberries
  at tea.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, September 23.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at 6. Came away,
  fearing it would be too late, without saying farewell to the
  Prior, which was mortifying, as there was time enough. We
  went to dine at St. Gingolph, beautifully placed on the bank
  of the Lake of Geneva. On the way we stopped at St.
  Maurice, where we saw in the church the rich shrine of St.
  Maurice, containing his body, and several others; two of the
  sons of Sigismund, King of Burgundy, who did penance
  here, after putting them to death. In the abbey, which is
  of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine, I saw the superior,
  who is a bishop <i>in partibus</i>; he spoke very kindly about
  England. I also met a nun there of a convent of Sisters of
  Charity, who promised for Thursdays at St. Gingolph. I
  went to the cur, where the Vicar introduced me to several
  priests dining with him, who became greatly interested, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
  promised to speak to the Bishop of Annecy, and to their
  <i>confrres</i> at Thonon, where we came to sleep. I called on
  the cur, who promised, but I could not quite satisfy myself
  about him; but was quite satisfied with the brothers of the
  Christian Doctrine; there are eight. The Superior promised
  well, and sent two brothers home with me to the inn. The
  names of the priests at St. Gingolph were:&mdash;M. Veuillet,
  Cur de Dsingy; M. Maitre, Cur de Novel; M. La Croix,
  Vicaire de Chilly; and M. Pollien, Vicaire de St. Gingolph.
  The first most interesting: the last extremely tall.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Sept. 24. B.M.V. di Mercede.&mdash;</span>At
  5 I went
  to the Convent of the Visitation, where there are thirty-four
  nuns, who have recovered their house after the Revolution.
  The Superioress received me most kindly, and
  promised all. I then went to the Sisters of Charity, who
  have two houses&mdash;a <i>pensionnat</i> and an hospital. The Superioress
  was not up. I left my card with a lay sister. I
  then went and said mass at the parish church. The
  Phillippses went to communion. It was at the altar of St.
  Francis of Sales, in this, the first church which he (or any
  other one) regained from the Calvinists&mdash;St. Hippolyte. I
  offered the mass for the recovery of our dear cathedrals.
  The cur spoke to me again, and much more zealously promised
  all for Thonon, M. De la Millire. We ought to
  have gone to the Chteau d'Allinges, where St. Francis
  lodged when he began the holy work. The chapel has been
  wonderfully preserved, and lately reopened, Sept. 14, 1836.
  On our way to Geneva, where we arrived at 12, we read
  some of the account of his mission. We came to the Hotel
  de Bergues, a new grand house in a new part of the town,
  built out on the lake about 1834. I took a carriage to
  Plainpalais, and brought back my good friend l'Abb de
  Baudry. I dined after at the <i>table d'hte</i>. He is a tall,
  venerable old man, dressed in his cassock, as all the priests are.
  His account of things here was better than I thought. We
  set off at 3, and could not get farther than Nyon, where
  Phillipps and I went to see the cur and his church, all new.
  There was no mission here till 1831. We interested him
  for England, I hope. The hotel is de la Couronne. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
  every room, as at Geneva, is a New Testament of the Geneva
  Bible Society.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Sept. 25.&mdash;</span>I
  went at 5 to say mass at the
  new church; the cur, M. Rossiaud, got up to serve it, and
  came with me to see us off. We went up the Jura; but
  the grand view of Mont Blanc was clouded, so we have but
  once seen it dimly. Yesterday evening we had a troublesome
  sorting of all our baggage at Les Rousses. We dined
  at St. Laurent. I went to the cur, M. Gottez, who spoke
  painfully of the state of France (I think too much so), but
  brightened up when we were about England. We went on
  to Champagnole, at the Htel de la Poste, a nice little inn.
  Phillipps and I went to the church; and I called and saw
  the cur, like Dr. Rock in looks. He accepted my appeal
  agreeably.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, Sept. 26.&mdash;</span>I
  got to say mass at the parish
  church, at 5. The cur, M. Patit, and the vicaire, M.
  Bouvet, were both up, and the latter walked back with me
  to the inn, la Poste. We started at 6; dined at 1 at
  l'Htel de France, at Dole: we got there at 12. I went
  out and saw a father at the Jesuits', who received me very
  agreeably; and then a nun at the Visitation Convent. The
  Jesuit promised for all the convents himself. The Prince
  and Princess Doria were come to the inn, on their way to
  Italy. When we came back, I went to see them after
  our dinner. We went on through Auxonne, where Phillipps
  and I went to see the church,&mdash;<i>diligence</i> to Dijon. Arrived
  at the Htel de la Cloche at 7. I went out to see the
  Bishop, but he was out. I called at the Sminaire, and saw
  the Superior and others, who were very kind, and spoke of
  Brother Luke asking them; then back to supper; after
  which I went again to the vch, and waited in the porter's
  lodge, talking to a nice old man of eighty about the Revolution,
  &amp;c., till the Bishop came in. He, Monseigneur
  Rivet, promised his help very graciously. I got home at 10,
  having also tried in vain to get at the sacristan for mass
  tomorrow.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, Sept. 27.&mdash;</span>I
  went out at ten minutes to 4, to try
  once more the sacristan's bell, but no answer, and so I had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
  to come back and give up mass, as we were to start at 5.
  We took provisions in the carriage, and we had no mind to
  stop all day, till at 7 we reached St. Florentin, a town of
  2,400 people, in the diocese of Sens. The weather was
  beautiful, and we admired the high cultivation and seeming
  prosperity of the country. We passed a fine chteau at
  Aucy le Franc, of the Duce or Marquis de Clermont-Tonnerre.
  At St. Florentin I went out and saw the cur and
  the sacristan, to provide better for mass to-morrow than today.
  Htel de la Poste.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  S<span class="quotehead">aturday, Sept. 28.&mdash;</span>Got
  up about 3. At a quarter to
  4 I went to the sacristan, and with him to the church, and
  said mass; a pretty little Gothic church. We set off at a
  quarter to 5, with provisions again, for Paris, which we
  entered about 11 at night. We stopped at Sens to see the
  cathedral. I first went to the archvch, and was most
  graciously received by the Archbishop, Monseigneur Mellon
  Jolly, a young man translated here from Sez last March.
  He said he had introduced prayers for England at Sez, and
  would begin again now. He took me into the cathedral,
  and left me to see the trsor, where the Phillippses already
  were. The most precious relic was of the true cross, as the
  sacristan said, the largest in the world; but he could not
  know of Rome and Jerusalem. It was given by Charlemagne.
  There are two pieces, placed in a cross under
  crystal; I should say the upright piece of nine or ten inches,
  the transverse of four or five, well polished. What was
  perhaps most interesting to us was the case containing St.
  Thomas of Canterbury's chasuble, alb with apparel, stole,
  &amp;c., from which the late Archbishop separated what he gave
  to Dr. Wiseman. There is also an arm of St. Lupus, a case
  of St. Gregory's relics, from which some have been begged
  for Rome. We stopped again at Fontainebleau, and took a
  rapid view of the palace. The servant who led said it was
  the finest in the world. I think he must be partial, as the
  sacristan this morning about the relic of the cross. Louis-Philippe
  has done a good deal here; spent 800,000 fr. in
  ornamenting one room. I was much pleased with the
  gallery with pictures of the history of France. This is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
  finest matter for a palace. There was much very indecent.
  After this it began to rain till we got to Paris. We got
  rooms at the Htel de l'Europe, just opposite the gardens of
  the Tuileries. Nothing could be better.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, Sept. 29.&mdash;</span>I
  went at 7 to say mass at the
  Madeleine, that glorious church for its style. Then home
  to breakfast, and then, with the rest, to high mass at Notre-Dame;
  one of the grandest plain chant masses I ever was
  at. There I met Mr. Moore, of Birmingham; and I went
  with him after, in his hackney-coach, on a few errands, and
  at last to the English convent, from whence he takes one of
  the Misses Bingham to the convent at Handsworth. Then
  I went again to Notre-Dame, and very much to my loss:
  I came too late for vespers. After, I went to St. Jacques,
  but did not find the Cur de Noirlieu, nor his vicaire. I
  came back by the omnibus to dine at the <i>restaurant</i>, and
  directly we went to Notre-Dame des Victoires, where we
  assisted at the service, from 7 to 20 minutes to 10. It was
  wonderful to see the attention of the people all this time.
  The old cur, after the sermon by another priest, gave the
  <i>annonces</i> in an interesting way. We heard him recommend
  England. I went in to ask him.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, Sept. 30.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at the Madeleine. After
  breakfast, I went to Mr. Blount, the banker, who told me
  that Heneage was to be in Paris on Thursday, the very day
  we go away. Then to the post, and find no letters; then
  by omnibus to St. Sulpice (where the retreat of the clergy
  begins to-day), to see the Archbishop. I was introduced to
  him in a room, where he was among several priests. I got
  on but poorly. He was gracious, but made little of the
  affair. The secretary of Mgr. Quelin was there. He testified
  to his recommending the thing before, but no effect
  followed. This was damping enough, though I knew something
  to the contrary. The Archbishop sent me to M.
  Vollemaux (Mr. Hand's friend), who conducts the retreat,
  and he promised to recommend England this evening. So
  the point is gained; though, judging from the tone in which
  he spoke of England, it is not so promising a prospect as
  some. But among 600 priests some will be inspired, let
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
  him speak as he may. I then went to the rue de Chaillot,
  to seek Captain Cooke, to know about John Beaumont. Had
  to come back empty, and stopped at home, not very well,
  till 5, when Phillippses came in from St. Denis to dinner.
  After dinner Mr. Gordon, of the <i>Univers</i>, came to tea, and
  stopped till 10 nearly.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Oct. 1.&mdash;</span>I
  went to say mass at Notre-Dame des
  Victoires, in les Petits Pres, at 8. I breakfasted near
  them, and had a talk with Abb Desgenettes. Then went
  to breakfast <i> la fourchette</i>, at 11, with M. Noirlieu, Cur
  of St. Jacques, and his vicaire, Bourjant. The latter forced
  me, against my will, to have some papers with an image
  and a prayer for England printed. It is the like case with
  Belgium. I hope it may be well, as it certainly was not
  my will, and so the denial of my will may be a blessing.
  We then went to call on the nuncio, Mgr. Fornari; and then
  to the engravers for this said work. Mgr. Fornari is grown
  very stout and unwieldy, but was very kind and pleasing;
  he encouraged my pursuit and this printing. We went
  home again to St. Jacques to <i>rdiger</i> the prayers, when again
  my friend would have his way against my mind in a point
  or two. I came thence to the Bank, M. Blount's, then
  home, and dined alone; then went to call on Captain Cooke,
  to ask about John Beaumont, who, it seems, does not come to
  Paris at all; then home, where I found the Phillippses going
  out to a spectacle, and so I had to go off and try to stop at
  l'Abb Desgenettes', who was to come to see him, but he
  was already from home, and so I came back and received his
  visit, when I pressed him for England, and he took it well.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Oct. 2.&mdash;</span>By
  desire of M. Gallard, Vicaire of
  the Madeleine, expressed by M. Bourgoiner, I said mass
  there. After breakfast, I called on Mrs. Heneage and her
  daughter, 17, rue St. Florentin; then took omnibus to St.
  Denis, where I looked through the church below ground and
  above. It is greatly altered since 1838&mdash;wonderful work of
  painting and stained glass, yet a very little is done of what
  has to be done. I came back by omnibus to Porte St.
  Martin; then walked home at 6. I dined with Captain
  Cooke&mdash;a family dinner, purely English, as he is himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
  I liked his conversation much, blunt and plain as it is. He
  talked of his twenty years' service&mdash;Egypt&mdash;America. I
  came home at 8 to meet MM. Noirlieu and Bourgoigne and
  Gordon, who came to tea and made interesting company till
  11, I think.

  mass at St. Roch; after, I went
  to the Jesuits, Rue des Postes, and saw the Provincial, M.
  Boulanger; then to the Sisters of Charity, Rue de Bac;
  the Sacr Coeur, where Mad. de Gramont gave me a most
  amiable reception; the Lazarists, Rue de Sevres; then I
  tried to see one of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and
  went with a zealous young clerk from their office, 37, Rue
  de Seine, St. Germain, to seek an <i>avocat</i> at the Palais de
  Justice. I was handing about the engravings, which were
  ordered on Tuesday, and which are well received. The sister,
  deputed to see me at the Sisters of Charity, alone, was cold.
  She was the same as six years ago, when she was very
  gracious. I came home to dine at 1 alone; at 2 I went to
  see Heneage, just arrived at his father and mother's from
  Dieppe. I sat an hour very happily with him, and came
  home at the time appointed to go away, but it was deferred
  till to-morrow. So I went to the chief house of the Ecoles
  Chrtiennes, about 126, Rue du Faubourg St. Martin. The
  Superior-General was very favourable, and promised to recommend
  England to his community of 300, and to the 400
  houses of his order. I then took omnibus to the Rue de
  Bac, and had an interesting conversation with Abb Dubois,
  now eighty years old. Ever since 1838, he prays for England
  every day in the mass. He is in retreat. He receives
  a pension of 100 a year from England. I went again and
  had tea with him, and so finished the day happily.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, Oct. 4.&mdash;</span>Mass
  at St. Roch. We started for
  Boulogne at 9. We stopped on the way to see the Church
  of St. Vincent de Paul, building in most splendid style, in
  form of a basilica inside, but with a portico without. Then
  I stopped at St. Denis, and walked round it again; saw in
  addition the winter choir most richly adorned. <i>Mem.</i>&mdash;The
  twelve Apostles holding the consecration crosses round the
  walls. We went on to dine at Beauvais. We went, when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
  it was growing dark, to take a look at the cathedral. The
  choir alone complete&mdash;the finest in the world. We said that
  the French, with their present zeal and prosperity, would
  finish this cathedral if the peace lasts ten more years. I
  left them in the church, and went to see the Bishop. He
  was at dinner, but came out and introduced me to the party,
  namely, the directors of the Seminary (among them my
  acquaintance, M. Bareau), and some Jesuits. He was most
  kind and favourable, and promised before them all that he
  would say mass for England once a week for a year. The
  others all sympathised. After this beautiful incident, I came
  home, and we dined at the cu de France. We afterwards drove
  on to Grandvilliers; arrived at 11. The King of the French
  dined there yesterday; the landlady was in raptures at it;
  there was the Queen, and in all twenty-six, at table.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, Oct. 5.&mdash;</span>As
  they failed to awake me, I missed
  saying mass. We set off at 6, and went, almost without a
  stop, dining in the carriage (135 kilometres, about 85 miles),
  to Boulogne, where we stopped at the Htel des Bains. I
  went directly to see the Grand Doyen, who was very kind.
  Returning, I found Mr. Digby with them. Louis-Philippe's
  birthday&mdash;71 years old.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, October 6.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at 8; got back to
  breakfast, and then we went together to the high mass, sung
  by Dr. Walsh, Bishop of Halifax. He had no mitre. After
  this, Mrs. Canning met me in the sacristy, and we went to
  her house, No. 5, Rue de Doyen. At 2 we walked to the
  Haute Ville, where we visited the Visitation Nuns in their
  grand new house, twenty-seven in number, and the Ursulines,
  fifty-two in number; then to M. Haffreingue. At 6
  I went to dine with the Digbys; saw Mrs. Digby for the
  first time. The Phillippses were there, and four or five
  more. I walked back with the Doyen in heavy rain at 10,
  and entered my lodgings with L'Abb Daniel, 73, Grande
  Rue.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, October 7.&mdash;</span>I
  went with Mrs. Canning to the
  Visitation Convent, and said the community mass at 9.
  After it we breakfasted in the parlour at 11. M. Haffreingue
  came in with the Phillippses, who had breakfasted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
  with him, and the Superioress, an English lady of the name
  of Muller, and other nuns, showed us round the house, which
  is most stately and beautiful, though it would have been
  wonderfully better had the money been spent on Gothic
  work. Mrs. Canning and I left at 12, and called on Mr.
  Errington. We came down to dine at 2. The Doyen and
  M. Daniel came. The Bishop also came to luncheon at 8.
  I went up to the Haute Ville, and first called on M. Gillies,
  a Scotch gentleman, converted last year; then went to
  Digby's for the evening. Besides Phillippses, &amp;c., I saw
  Nicholas Ball. Came back at 10.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, October 8.&mdash;</span>Said
  mass at 7; then went to
  breakfast with Mrs. Canning. About 11 we set off for the
  Haute Ville, and went once more to the Visitation Convent,
  where we were allowed to see the whole community through
  their grate for three quarters of an hour, that I might do my
  best to recommend England, which I tried to do. Then I
  visited M. Gillies, and got down to dinner at 2. M. Le
  Cointe, M. Le Roy, and M. Daniel, dined with us. After
  dinner we went out and visited, first, the Soeurs Grises, an
  austere convent of poor nuns, who teach school. They
  have 900 girls under care. The Superioress promised for all;
  if she fulfils it, it is a fine gain. Then to the Ecoles
  Chrtiennes. They are seventeen brothers, teaching 1,100 boys
  in different schools. They were very encouraging; promised
  for themselves and the boys. After an hour's office and tea,
  I went to the Haute Ville to see Phillipps and his party at
  Digby's for the last time, as they go to-morrow. Met Mr.
  W. Jones and wife, and others. Then at 9 I went to visit
  Judge Ball at the Htel de Londres. The Bishop and others
  were there. The family was Mr. Ball, Nicholas, and
  Alexander, and a daughter.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, October 9.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at the Ursulines at
  7, first addressing them on England for a quarter of an
  hour. Then breakfasted, during which six English nuns
  were in attendance, and Miss Swift. Then my cousin and
  I walked to the Annonciades, when we could not see the
  Superioress; then to the Dames de Notre-Dame du bon Secours
  (<i>gardes malades</i>, seventeen nuns). Then in the Basse Ville
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
  to the Hospitalieres (thirteen nuns); these promised well.
  Then I went home to office till dinner at 2. Mrs. Canning
  and M. Tallier, Cur de Nemfchatel, who takes care of them,
  came over to meet me. At 4 M. Thillay came. These two
  promised to do all they could. At 5 Mrs. C. and I walked
  to the steamboat office, post-office, &amp;c. Came back to office
  and tea. Then I went up to change my quarters, and pass
  some days at the college with M. Haffreingue. I first called
  and saw Mrs. Gillies. I sat some time with M. Haffreingue,
  and to bed at 10.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, October 10.&mdash;</span>Said
  mass at  to 8. At 10 Dr.
  Walsh came up and sung mass <i>de Spiritu Sancto</i>, for the
  opening of studies. The boys came back yesterday. I
  assisted him as Assistant Deacon. At 1 we dined. The
  Bishop, M. O'Reilly, and a M. Cardham, a London convert,
  were all the strangers. The rest were the professors of the
  house. After dinner we had toasts, cheers, and speeches, on
  England, Mr. O'Reilly leading it. At 10, I went and saw
  Abbate Melia at Mrs. Errington's. He is going to replace
  Baldacconi in London. Then to Mrs. Canning's to tea.
  Returned for night prayers at 7. Supper comes after. I
  talked to M. Haffreingue about architecture.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Friday, October 11.&mdash;</span>I
  said mass at 7 in the chapel of
  Notre-Dame de Boulogne; breakfasted with M. Haffreingue.
  At 10 I called on Digby, then Mrs. Canning, and Mrs.
  Gillies. I dined in the Infirmary, to eat meat with M.
  Grettan, the English teacher, and little Rosamel, grandson
  of a great admiral. M. Haffreingue and I took a walk, and
  went through the crypt of the cathedral. Night prayers
  and supper in the refectory at 7. After it, M. Haffreingue
  and I went to call on Mrs. Muller and Digby.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Saturday, October 12.&mdash;</span>Said
  mass in the Chapelle de
  Notre-Dame. Miss Muller breakfasted with us. She is
  the great support of M. Haffreingue's great work of building
  the cathedral, having begged for it for years past. I asked
  her to have prayers made for England, as M. Haffreingue
  announces the cathedral to be undertaken mainly for that
  enterprise. She promised to interest the poor. I thought
  of my sermon, and did other things till near 12. When I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
  went out, called on Mr. Stewart, a Scotch pastrycook, lately
  converted and received by Sisk. At 1, I dined (<i>gras</i>) with Mrs.
  Canning. After, called on Lady Burke and her two daughters,
  near the Porte. Came back after; walked an hour in the
  Grande Salle with Haffreingue, talking over projects for
  England and France.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Sunday, October 13.&mdash;</span>Got
  up after 7, and sung high mass
  in the chapel at 9. After it I went to Mrs. Canning's till
  dinner time, when I returned and dined in the refectory.
  The afternoon was mostly preparing my sermon, which I
  preached on the conversion of England at the <i>salut</i> at 7. The
  boys clapped their hands to my surprise when I entered the
  refectory to supper; in token of acceptance, I hope. I got
  on better than I could have thought, and was not a bit tired.
  After supper I went with M. Haffreingue and M. Le Roy; a
  farewell visit to Digby. It blows hard, and I fear it will be
  a bad passage to-morrow, or none at all.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Monday, October 14.&mdash;</span>The
  Abbate Melia, Dr. Baldacconi's
  intended successor, came to sing songs, and breakfast
  at the college, and went down with me to the port. Mr.
  Bodenham came with us, too. We waited from 9 till 10.20
  before they set off. They seemed to fear the wind. When
  we got out it was a most stormy passage to Folkestone, of
  three hours. I stood up all the way, holding on, talking
  with M. Crawley, of the Hotel, Albemarle Street, except we
  were nearly sick. We swung through the narrow walk of
  Folkestone Harbour, and were at once smooth, and soon on
  England's soil. It was a long work passing the Custom
  House, but we got off by a train at 3.49. I set Mr. Melia
  down at Pagliano's, where we found Dr. Walsh (of Halifax),
  and had tea. Sisk and Mgr. Eyre came in by good fortune,
  and I went with them home to their quarters at the Chelsea
  chapel-house.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday, October 15.&mdash;</span>Said
  mass at 8. Then went to
  try Dr. Chambers, who is out of town. Then to Spence
  House, and saw Appleyard. By his advice, I determined to
  go to Windsor to-day, the Queen being just now away. I
  called on Father Lithgoe, and attended a meeting of ladies
  at Sisk's, then off by the Great Western Railway to Slough,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
  and so to Windsor. I saw Caroline at Lady Grant's, where
  she lodges, close to the Castle, where I dined at 8, first having
  seen Sarah at the Castle, and the Prince of Wales, with
  whom she was playing. He is a weakly-looking child of
  four, but noble and clever looking. He behaved prettily to
  us all in going off to bed.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Wednesday, October 16.&mdash;</span>After
  sleeping at the Castle
  Inn, I walked to the Catholic chapel at Chrom, attended
  last Sunday by Louis-Philippe, who charmed them all. I
  said mass, and then Mr. Wilson took me in a gig a mile on
  to call on Mr. Riley, at Forest Hill. He was out. I thence
  called to Windsor, and was with Sarah from 12 to 1, while
  the children were asleep. Then went down to Eton, called
  on Mr. Coleridge, then walked about the well-known places,
  the chapel, the cloisters, where I left a card on Wilder, now
  a fellow. I went and mused over the place which once was
  Godley's, but all is levelled. I stood by the oak-tree there,
  saw the boys assembling for 3 o'clock school, and talked to
  some. I brought back many a scene thirty years and more
  ago. At 3, started back and dined with Sisk. After dinner
  we went to see Mrs. Bagshawe and Mrs. Jauch back in an
  omnibus.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Thursday, October 17.&mdash;</span>Mass
  at 8. Went to see Dr. Watson,
  whom I found to be my former friend, fellow of St. John's.
  It was a good account of me, thank God. Then to Mr.
  Nerincx, at Somers Town. Then to Mr. Morel, at Hampstead,
  and Mrs. Sankey, near him; then called at the Sardinian
  Chapel, and home to dine, and sit the evening with
  Sisk.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
Close Of His Career In Oscott; And His Religious
Vocation.</h2>
<br>
<p>
During the year 1845 his attention was greatly occupied
with the converts that were coming daily into the Church
through the Oxford movement. As Father Spencer was
not a mover in it, and as its history has been written over
and over by different members of it, it would be superfluous
to give anything like a sketch of it in such a work as this.
Father Spencer seemed to have great interest in Dr.
Newman, as also Dr. Ward, Canon Oakeley, and Father
Faber. Many of them go to Oscott, some to be received,
and some to make their studies for the Church; and in the
beginning of the year 1846 he writes that he had twelve
who were Anglican clergymen assisting at his mass one day
in Oscott, and that there were three more who might have
been, but were unable to come.
</p>
<p>
He takes advantage of the Feast of St. Pius V. to preach
his famous sermon on Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones. In
a few days he assists at the ordination of the present Bishop
of Northampton, the Right Rev. Dr. Amherst. A number
of converts received orders at the same time, and Father
Spencer had the pleasure of assisting at the ceremony. He
resumes his Journal in May, 1846, and we find these two
entries in it:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Tuesday, June 9.&mdash;</span>
  We had news to-day of
  the death of Pope Gregory XVI. on the 1st of June, after
  fifteen years and four months' pontificate. God grant a holy
  successor, full of fortitude and love, especially for England."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">June 22.</span>
  News of Cardinal Feretti being Pope (Pius IX.).
  The brave Bishop of Imola, who stopped the progress of the
  insurgents in 1831. I am perfectly satisfied."
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
<p>
He went into retreat at Hodder under the direction of
Father Clarke, S.J., and the result of that retreat was that
he became a Passionist. We shall give a letter he wrote to
Mr. Phillipps at the time, in which he gives a full account
of how this was brought about.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">"St. Benedict's Priory, Feast of St. John Cantius,<br>
  "Oct. 22, 1846.</span><br>
<br>
  "My Dear Ambrose,&mdash;Yesterday, for the first time this
  long time, I heard where you were, and that you were
  within reach again of a Queen's head. This was from Mrs.
  Henry Whitgrave, next to whom I sat at dinner yesterday,
  at the Clifford Arms, Great Heywood, after the opening
  high mass of the new chapel there, which she and her
  husband came from Rugeley to attend. I determined not to
  lose another day in writing to you, lest you should hear
  from others, which I should not be pleased with, the news I
  have to give about myself. Perhaps you have already heard
  of it; but it is not my fault that you have not had the news
  from me. The news in question is that I am going to become
  a Passionist. You have frequently told me your persuasion,
  that what would be for my happiness would be to
  join a religious institute, and therefore I am confident you
  will rejoice with me at my prejudices being overcome, my
  fond schemes of other plans of my own set aside, and this
  good step at length determined on; though I can imagine that
  you will perhaps regret that the body which I join is not
  that with which you are most connected yourself, the Institute
  of Charity. Surprised I dare say you will not be much.
  Many others have received the declaration of this intention
  without any surprise, and only told me that they had been
  used to wonder how I did not long ago take such a step.
  You will only be surprised and wonder how I have come to
  this mind, after such decided purposes, as I have always expressed
  the contrary way. I can only say, Glory be to God,
  to our Blessed Lady, and St. Ignatius. It was entirely
  owing to the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius, which I
  have gone through twice, and only twice, in private and
  alone in the effective way. Once was at Louvain, where
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
  you parted from me two years ago to go to Knigswinter,
  and the other time was this summer, when I went for a
  retreat at Hodder Place, under your friend Father Thomas
  Clarke, who is Master of Novices there. For two or three
  days in the course of the former of these retreats, I was
  brought (for the first time) to doubt whether I ought not to
  give up my own ideas, and take to the regular established
  course of entering religion; and the old Jesuit who directed
  me in that retreat, when I expressed these new ideas,
  seemed at first to think they would lead to this conclusion.
  But I suppose I was not ripe for it, or God's time was not
  come. It ended by his telling me to put aside all those
  thoughts, and go on as I was. So I did, and was without
  any idea of the kind till the middle of this second retreat,
  which I entered with no view but to get on better where I
  was for another year. The same meditations raised up
  again the same battle within me as at Louvain, and I saw
  no way but to go into the matter, and make my election
  according to the rules given by St. Ignatius; which, if they
  were applied more often to questions of importance which
  people have to settle, ah! we should have many resolutions
  come to different to what are come to in the world. I soon
  came to determine for a change of state; then came the
  question which body to choose, and for a whole day nearly
  this was working my thoughts up and down. I could see
  no prospect of deciding between the two which came before
  me at first and for which I found my feelings and my
  judgment alternately inclining me&mdash;these were the Jesuits
  and the Institute of Charity. I saw no prospect of making
  up my mind that day, though Father Clarke told me now
  was the time for such a choice, and not when I had gone
  out again into the world, and I knew that God whom I had
  sought in solitude would give me light. At last, when I
  had just finished my last meditation of that portion of the
  retreat, and still could not settle, I thought I must have
  recourse after the retreat was over to Father Dominic, as a
  neutral judge, to help me to choose between the other two;
  when, in a minute, as in the fable of the two men who
  found the oyster and called in the third to judge between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
  them, I saw that Father Dominic himself was to have me,
  such as I was, and all my doubts vanished. Father Clarke
  came soon afterwards to pay me his daily visit, and confirmed
  my choice with a manner and tone as unhesitating
  as the choice itself had been, and would not let me afterwards
  give way to the fear of any difficulties, saying, once
  for all, when I was questioning how I could get over some
  of them, 'Well, if you do not get over them, God has been
  deceiving you.' How I extol now and praise the practice
  of spiritual exercises, and St. Ignatius, the great founder of
  the system of them, and the Jesuits in their conduct of
  them, as exemplified in Father Clarke, whose way with
  me so completely gave the lie to what people are disposed to
  think, that the Jesuits must bring everything and everybody
  to themselves when they get them into their hands. I
  intend to express my sense of obligation to them and St.
  Ignatius, by taking his name as my future designation, after
  I am admitted to the religious habit. So I hope in time I
  may come to be known no more by my own name, but by
  that of <i>Ignatius of St. Paul</i>. And as God gives me this
  <i>nomen novum</i> may he add the <i>manna absconditum</i>, and
  make me in spirit as different from what I have been as in
  name. It is a great satisfaction that all this was settled
  without Father Dominic or any Passionist having a hint of
  it, till I went up to London three days after the retreat, to
  tell him of the determination I had made. The next day I
  came back to Oscott, and told Dr. Wiseman. He was, of
  course, surprised at the news, and at first seemed to think I
  could not be really in earnest, but ever since has acted in
  the most considerate and kind manner towards me. My
  move, I am sorry to think, must entail on him and dear
  Bishop Walsh serious inconveniences, not so much for the
  loss of my services where they had placed me, for I hope if
  I live I may serve them better as I shall be circumstanced
  hereafter, as I was doing little at Oscott, but from the withdrawal
  of my funds, which I fear may take place perhaps
  even to their entire amount, but certainly in great part.
  Not that any part goes to the congregation (of the Passion);
  thank God, I am received there <i>in form pauperis</i> and all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
  which remains to me would be left to the Bishop; but my
  dear brother seems quite determined to make my vow of
  poverty as much one in earnest as it can be; and so, bitter
  as that part of the trial is, God bless him for it! I think I
  must have told you how my income came to me. My father
  left me a certain capital quite independently, which went
  long ago to building churches, and 300 a year to be paid
  to me as long as I did not put it out of my own power, in
  which case it was to be in the power of my brother, now
  living, and other trustees, to be employed to my advantage.
  My late brother gave me as much more of his own free will,
  and this brother has hitherto continued this, but now says
  that he cannot give it to support Catholicity; and as he will
  not use it himself, it is to go for my lifetime to religious
  and charitable purposes such as he thinks fit. So half of my
  money is clean gone, and the other half depends upon what
  interpretation the law puts on the terms of my father's will.
  Bishop Wiseman takes this so beautifully and disinterestedly,
  that I trust the loss he thus bears for God's sake will be
  more than amply compensated to him. My sister, Lady
  Lyttelton, takes my change beautifully."
</p>
<p>
The pecuniary losses his ecclesiastical superiors would
sustain prevented them giving him the opposition they
otherwise would. It would not look well to try to keep
him out of religion, under the circumstances; and besides,
Cardinal Wiseman was not the person to prevent his priests
becoming religious, if he were only convinced they had a
vocation.
</p>
<p>
When Father Spencer was on his way to London to consult
with Father Dominic about his reception, a musket
went off by accident in the carriage he was in, and the ball
passed through the skylight. This gave him rather a start,
and made him think a little about the shortness of life. He
appears to have found Father Dominic giving a retreat to
the nuns of the Sacr Coeur, who are now at Roehampton.
The saintly Passionist was delighted with the news, and
Father Ignatius used to say that he seemed to be more delighted
still at the fact that he was not bringing a penny to
the order. On his return to Oscott, the first thing we heard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
was that a Quaker had been converted by a sermon he
preached in Birkenhead, which sermon he thought himself
was about the worst he ever delivered. He meets a little
opposition, however; they wish him to stay until his
thoughts get settled into their original state after the retreat.
He fears this to be a stratagem of the enemy, and,
lest it might make him lose his vocation, he makes a vow of
entering religion at or before Christmas. When this became
known, nobody could in conscience oppose him, for only the
Pope could dispense him from entering now.
</p>
<p>
At length everything is settled. His 300 income remains
to the Bishop and his brother promises to provide for
his pensioners. All things being thus arranged, he visits
all the poor people about Oscott and West Bromwich, to
give them a parting advice and blessing, spiritual and temporal.
He writes to all his friends, packs up his books and
other smaller movables, receives two converts&mdash;Laing and

<h1>BOOK IV.<br>
<i>F. Ignatius, a Passionist.</i></h1>
<br>


<h2>CHAPTER I.<br>
The Noviciate.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Religious orders in the Church may be compared
to a vast army, composed of different
regiments, with different uniforms, different
tactics, and different posts in the kingdom of
God, offensive and defensive, against the
kingdom of Satan. The Pope is the head of all, and
various generals bear rule, in his name, over the forces
who have chosen them for their leaders.
</p>
<p>
Some religious orders fill chairs in universities; others
are charged with the instruction of youth. Some watch by
the sickbed; others ransom captive slaves, or bring consolation
to the miserable in prisons and asylums. Some, again,
work at the rooting out of sin and disorders at home, whilst
others carry the light of the Gospel to the heathen. Some
pitch their tents in deserts or mountain fastnesses, whilst a
more numerous body take up their abode in the abandoned
purlieus of crowded cities.
</p>
<p>
Every religious order has some one characteristic spirit, a
mark by which it may be distinguished from the others.
This may be called the genius of the order. It is mostly
the spirit that animated the founder when he gathered his
first companions around him, and drew up the code by which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
their lives were to be regulated. This spirit may be suited
to one age and not to another; it may be local or universal;
on its scope depends the existence and spread of the order;
its decay or unsuitableness will portend the extinction of the
body it animated.
</p>
<p>
This spirit may take in the whole battle-field of religion,
and then we see members of that order in every post in
which an advantage may be gained, or a blow dealt upon
the enemy. It may take in some parts and leave the rest
to the different battalions that are already in charge, prepared
to render assistance in any department as soon as its
services may be needed.
</p>
<p>
The religious order known as the Congregation of the
Passion has a peculiar spirit and a special work. It was
founded by Blessed Paul of the Cross in the middle of the
last century, and approved by Benedict XIV., Clement XIV.,
and Pius VI. Its object is to work in whatever portion of
the Church it may have a house established, for the uprooting
of sin, and the planting of virtue in the hearts of
the faithful. The means it brings to this, in addition to the
usual ones of preaching and hearing confessions, is a spreading
among Christians a devotion to and a grateful, lively
remembrance of the Passion of our Lord. The Passionists carry
out this work by missions and retreats, as well as parish
work in their own houses. If circumstances need it, they
take charge of a parish; if not, they do the work of missioners
in their own churches. They teach none except
their own younger members, and they go on foreign missions
when sent by His Holiness or the Propaganda.
</p>
<p>
To keep the members of an order always ready for their
out-door work, there are certain rules for their interior life
which may be likened to the drill or parade of soldiers in
their quarters. This discipline varies according to the spirit
of each order.
</p>
<p>
The idea of a Passionist's work will lead us to expect what
his discipline must be. The spirit of a Passionist is a spirit
of atonement; he says, with St. Paul: "I rejoice in my
sufferings, and fill up those things that are wanting of the
sufferings of Christ, in my flesh for His body, which is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
Church." Coloss. i. 24. For this cause, the interior life of a
Passionist is rather austere. He has to rise shortly after
midnight, from a bed of straw, to chaunt matins and lauds,
and spend some time in meditation. He has two hours
more meditation during the day, and altogether about five
hours of choir-work in the twenty-four. He fasts and
abstains from flesh meat three days in the week, all the year
round, besides Lent and Advent. He is clad in a coarse
black garment; wears sandals instead of shoes; and practises
other acts of penance of minor importance.
</p>
<p>
This seems rather a hard life; but an ordinary constitution
does not find the least difficulty in complying with the
letter of the rule. It is withal a happy, cheerful life; for it
seems the nature of penance to make the heart of the penitent
light and gladsome, "rejoicing in suffering." Two
facts are proved by experience. First, that scarcely one
ever left the order on account of the corporal austerities,
though they are used as a plea to justify the step by those
who lose the religious spirit. Secondly, longevity is more
common amongst us than any other order, except perhaps
the Cistercians, whose rule is far more severe than ours. A
Passionist is bound by this rule only within the retreat, as
houses of the order are called; outside, he follows the Gospel
ordinance of partaking of what is set before him, and suiting
himself to the circumstances in which he is placed. The
Superior, moreover, has a discretionary power of granting
exemptions, in favour of those who require some indulgence
in consequence of illness or extra labour.
</p>
<p>
It will be seen, from this sketch, that Passionists have to
lay up a stock of virtue, by a monastic life at home, in order
that their ministrations for their neighbour may be attended
with more abundant fruit. They unite the active and contemplative
spirit, that both may help to the saving of their
own souls by qualifying them better for aiding in the salvation
of others.
</p>
<p>
This was the kind of life Father Spencer began to lead on
his forty-seventh birthday. For a man of his age, with
habits formed, with health subject to occasional shocks, it
was certainly a formidable undertaking. There was little of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
human glory to eclipse those difficulties in the community
he entered. Four foreign fathers, living in a wretched
house, as yet unable to speak passable English, without a
church, without friends, without funds, without influence,
formed the principal portion of the community of Aston
Hall. These were, Father Dominic, Father Gaudentius,
Father Constantine, and Father Vincent. None of these
four fathers are in the province at present. Fathers Dominic
and Constantine are dead. Father Gaudentius is a
member of the American province; and Father Vincent,
after many years of zealous missionary work in these
countries, was called to Rome, where he now holds the
office of Procurator-General. They had one student, two
lay brothers, and Father Spencer was to be the second
of two novices. The Passionists had already been four
years in England, and, through trials and difficulties,
from poverty and misunderstandings, had worked their way
up to the precarious position in which he found them. He
was, therefore, a great acquisition to the struggling community.
True, he brought no earthly riches; but he brought
what was more valued, an unearthly spirit&mdash;he brought
humility, docility, and burning zeal.
</p>
<p>
The fathers knew him for a long time, and scarcely required
proofs to convince them of his having a religious
vocation, since he had practised the vows before then in a
very perfect way, considering his state. He gave clear
proofs of his spirit on the eve of his coming to Aston. He
came, as he glories in telling Mr. Phillipps, <i>in form pauperis</i>.
Some of his friends wished to give him the price of
his habit by way of alms; he would not accept of it. He
then reflected on the poverty of the Passionists, and thought
it would be well if he brought even so much, whereupon he
proposed to beg the money. The largest alms he intended
to receive was half-a-crown. He was forbidden to do this
by his director, and obeyed at once: thus giving a proof of
his spirit of poverty and obedience.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding all this, the fathers were determined
to judge for themselves, and try by experiment if any
aristocratic <i>hauteur</i> might yet lurk in the corners of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
disposition. Our rule, moreover, requires that postulants be
tried by humiliations before being admitted to the habit;
and many and various are the tests applied, depending, as
they do, on the judgment of the master of novices. One
clause of the rule was especially applicable to Father Spencer:
"<i>Qui nobili ortus est genere, accuratiore et diuturniore
experimento probetur</i>; "and the strict Father Constantine, who
was then the master, resolved that not a word of it should
be unfulfilled. A day or two after his arrival, he was
ordered to wash down an old, rusty flight of stairs. He
tucked up his sleeves and fell to, using his brush, tub, and
soapsuds with as much zest and good will as if he had been
just hired as a maid-of-all-work. Of course, he was no great
adept at this kind of employment, and probably his want of
skill drew down some sharp rebukes from his overseer.
Some tender-hearted religious never could forget the sight of
this venerable ecclesiastic trying to scour the crevices and
crannies to the satisfaction of his new master. He got
through it well, and took the corrections so beautifully, that
in a few days he was voted to the habit.
</p>
<p>
On the afternoon of the 5th January, 1847, vespers are
just concluded, and the bell is rung for another function.
People are hurrying up to the little chapel, and whispering
to each other about the scene they are going to witness.
The altar is prepared as for a feast. The thurifers and
acolytes head the procession from the sacristy; next follow
the religious; then Father Dominic arrayed in surplice and
cope. After him follows Father Spencer, in the costume of
a secular priest. He kneels on the altar step; he has laid
aside long before all that the world could give him; he has
thrown its greatness and its folly away as vanities to be
despised, and now asks for the penitential garb of the sons
of the Passion, with all its concomitant hardships. He had
not yet experienced the happiness it brings: he had only
begun to earn it by broken rest, fasts, and humiliations.
Father Dominic blesses the habit, mantle, and cincture; he
addresses a few touching words to the postulant, and prepares
to vest him. In the presence of all he takes off the
cassock, the habit is put on and bound with a leathern
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
girdle, a cross is placed upon his shoulder, a crown of thorns
on his head, benedictions are invoked upon him according
to the ritual, the religious intone the <i>Ecce quam bonum</i>,
Our Lord gives His blessing from the Monstrance, and the
Honourable and Reverend-George Spencer is greeted as a
brother and companion by Father Dominic, under the new
name of Father Ignatius of St. Paul. Thus ended the
function of that day, and the benisons of the rite were not
pronounced in vain.
</p>
<p>
It is the custom with us to drop the family name on our
reception, to signify the cutting away of all carnal ties,
except inasmuch as they may help to benefit souls. A
religious should be dead to nature, and his relationship
henceforth is with the saints. This is why, among many
religious orders of men, and nearly all of women, some
saint or some mystery of religion to which the novice is
specially devoted is substituted instead of the family name.
In most cases, also, the Christian name is changed; this,
following the example of our Lord, who changed the names
of some of the Apostles, is useful in many ways, as well to
typify newness of life as to help in distinguishing one from
another when the aid of family names is taken away.
Father Ignatius gave his reasons above for preferring this
name, and events, both before and after, make us applaud
the fitness of the choice.
</p>
<p>
A novice's life is a very eventless one; it has little in it
of importance to others, though it is of so much consequence
to himself. The coming of a postulant, the going away of a
newly-made brother, the mistakes of a tyro at bell-ringing,
chanting, or ceremonies, are of interest enough to occupy
several recreations. The absence of soul-stirring news from
without gives these trifles room to swell into importance.
When the little incidents are invested with ludicrous or
peculiar circumstances, they often have a sheet of the chronicles
dedicated to their history by the most witty or least
busy of the novices.
</p>
<p>
A postulant ran away the day after Father Ignatius was
clothed; he heard the religious take the discipline, and no
amount of explanations or coaxing could induce him to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
accustom his ear to the noise, much less his body to the
stripes, of this function. The senior novice left at the same
time; he was a priest, and died on the London mission the
very same year as Father Ignatius. In a few days more
Father Dominic caught a novice dressing his hair and giving
himself airs before a looking-glass. His habit was stripped
off, and he was sent to the outer world, where, perhaps, the
adorning of his good looks was of more service to him than
it was at Aston Hall.
</p>
<p>
It is a received tradition in the religious life that vocations
which are not tried by difficulties seldom prove sea-worthy,
so to speak. Before or after the novice enters, he
must be opposed and disappointed in some way; he has to
pay dear for the favour of serving God in this state of life,
if he be destined to act any important part in the Church as
a religious. Father Ignatius had his trials. He found it
difficult to pick up all the <i>minutiae</i> of novice discipline: he
suffered a little from homesickness, and these, joined to
chilled feet, a hard bed, and meagre food, did not allow him
to enjoy to any great extent the delightful sensation known
as <i>fervor novitiorum</i>. He got over all this, as we see from
a letter he wrote to a friend in March:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
"I am here in a
state in which not a shadow of trouble seems to come, but
what I cause for myself. With a little humility there is
peace enough. I suppose I shall have some more troubles
hereafter if I live. I have not been so well for several
years. Some would have thought a Lent without a bit of
meat would not have done for me; but I have seen now
since Shrove Tuesday, and, in Lent or out of it, I never
have been better. So in that respect, viz., my health, I
suppose my trial here is satisfactory."
</p>
<p>
A rude shock was in store for his health which he little
anticipated when he wrote those lines. This was the terrible
year of famine in Ireland, that year which will be
remembered for ever by those who lived in the midst of the
harrowing scenes that overspread that unhappy country.
Poor famishing creatures, who had laid their fathers or
mothers, and perhaps their children, in coffinless graves,
begged their way to England, and began that tide of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
emigration which has since peopled Liverpool, Manchester,
Birmingham, and London, with such crowds of Catholics.
Every ship brought its cargo of misery, and the hapless
victims were forced by their poverty to seek for lodgings in
dens of vice, or employment where virtue was not paramount.
They thus imbibed a poison to their morals which
has not yet been completely purged out of the thousands
who have had to follow the footsteps of their famine-stricken
predecessors. Numbers of the poor Irish gathered around
Stone and Aston; fever broke out amongst them, and the
wards of the workhouse infirmaries were unable to contain
even a moiety of the sufferers. Every hovel and barn had
their burning occupants, and even charity itself seemed
frightened from giving assistance. The priest was, of
course, busy; and, fortunately for Aston, more than one
priest could be had to attend the dying.
</p>
<p>
All our fathers were at the bed of death many times in
the day. Father Gaudentius was struck down with fever,
Father Vincent followed next. The duties now devolved
upon Father Dominic and Father Ignatius. The poor
novice was prostrated by the pestilence, after administering
the last rites of the Church to many. He gets a very
malignant attack, and in a few days is at the point of death.
He prepared for his last passage with the most beautiful
dispositions. He thanked God for the privilege of his
state, and was particularly delighted at the prospect of
dying a martyr to his charity. He receives the Viaticum
and Extreme Unction, makes his profession as on death-bed,
becomes insensible, and is given an hour to live by the
doctors. The religious commence a novena, in which they
are joined by the people, for his recovery. God preserved
him to his brethren and their flock, for he began immediately
to mend. We may form an idea of this poor community,
all the active members, except Father Dominic,
dying, or in feeble convalescence; their resources, perhaps,
run out; and all the energy they had left taxed to its
utmost to answer the calls of duty. Few as they were,
they had not the least idea of sparing themselves. They
still hoped to increase and multiply; but, after the example
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
of Him who increased by dying, and likened the progress
of His Church to the dying of the grain of corn in the soil
of its growth.
</p>
<p>
Charitable friends came to their assistance, and amongst
the rest, Earl Spencer sent a handsome sum to pay doctors'
expenses for his brother. This was considerate, indeed,
and as soon as Father Ignatius could manage a pen, he
wrote to thank him for his charity. Numbers were deeply
concerned for our novice, and two or three Catholic nobles
invited him to come and stay with them during his convalescence.
Father Dominic did not think him sufficiently ill
to warrant his sleeping out of the house, so their kind offers
were thankfully declined.
</p>
<p>
This illness was a double blow to Father Ignatius: he had
just received orders from his Superior to prepare for the
missions when it came on. An end was put to his preparation
for the time, but he resumed the task as soon as the
doctors allowed him.
</p>
<p>
During his noviciate he had two kinds of trials to endure,
besides those mentioned already. Father Constantine was
remarkable for his meekness and charity; but he put on
extra severity for Father Ignatius. His companions tried
to show him some marks of distinction, and would offer to
relieve him from works that were humiliating, or likely to
be galling to one of his standing. The latter trial he complained
of, and he was troubled at the other because some of
of the religious complained of the novice-master's severity
towards him. He had some more mortifications of the kind
he playfully told us a few chapters back, as affecting Father
Dominic in Oscott. He was troubled with chilblains, and
was obliged, in consequence, to wear shoes and stockings for
a great part of his noviciate. This he looked upon as a
great grievance, inasmuch as he could not live like the
others. When at last the chilblains got well, and he was
allowed to put on the sandals, he felt overjoyed, and even
writes a letter to congratulate himself on his happiness.
</p>
<p>
He writes two or three letters, in which he notes his
astonishment at the Irish being so negligent in England,
who had been so regular at home. He says, they all send
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
for the priest, and show great signs of repentance when
dying; but, out of a number he attended, only one returned
to the Church after recovery. "Still," he says, "it would
be long till one of them would answer as the English
pensioner is reported to have done on his death-bed. The
minister talked much about Heaven and its happiness, but
the patient coolly replied, 'It's all very well, sir; but old
England and King George for me!'"
</p>
<p>
His noviciate glides quietly on to its end; and except his
ordinary work of attending to a mission in Stone besides his
home duties, nothing occurs to break the monotony.
</p>
<p>
At length, on the 6th of January, 1848, Father Ignatius
and Father Dominic remain up after matins. We are told
in the Journal, that the novice made his confession and had
a long conference with his director, in preparation for the
great event of his profession. Father Dominic was going
off that day, but the conveyance disappointed him, he was
obliged to wait till the next. That evening Father Ignatius
is once more in the midst of a moving ceremony: on his
knees, with his hands placed in Father Dominic's he pronounces
his irrevocable consecration by the vows of his
religious profession.[Footnote 10]
The badges are affixed to his breast,
the sacrifice is completed&mdash;and well and worthily was it
carried out. It is easier to imagine than to describe the joy
of the two holy friends, so long united in the bonds of heavenly
charity, as they spoke that day about their first
acquaintance, and wondered at the dispositions of Providence,
which now made them more than brothers.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  [Footnote 10:
  The profession on death-bed is conditional, so that if a novice
  recovers, after thus pronouncing his vows, he has to go on as if they
  had not been made.]
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br>
His First Year As A Passionist.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Shortly after his profession, Father Ignatius was sent out
on missions. The first mission he gave, with Father Gaudentius,
was to his old parishioners of West Bromwich.
Crowds came to hear him; some to have another affectionate
look, and hear once more the well-known voice of their old
pastor; others from curiosity to see what he had been transformed
into by the monks. This mission was very successful,
for, besides the usual work of the reconciliation of sinners,
and the helping on of the fervent, there were fifteen Protestants
received into the Church before its close. He gives
another mission somewhere in the Borough, London, with
the same companion. During this mission he hears that his
style of preaching is not liked much by the Irish; he feels
a little sad at this, as he fears the work may fail of success
through his deficiency.
</p>
<p>
The preaching of Father Ignatius was peculiar to himself;
he cannot be said to possess the gifts of human eloquence
in the highest degree, but there was a something like inspiration
in his most commonplace discourse. He put the
point of his sermon clearly before his audience, and he proved
it most admirably. His acquaintance with the Scriptures
was something marvellous; not only could he quote texts
in support of doctrines, but he applied the facts of the sacred
volume in such a happy way, with such a flood of new ideas,
that one would imagine he lived in the midst of them, or
had been told by the sacred writers what they were intended
for. Besides this, he brought a fund of illustrations to carry
conviction through and through the mind. His illustrations
were taken from every phase of life, and every kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
employment; persons listening to him always found the practical
gist of his discourse carried into their very homestead; nay,
the objections they themselves were prepared to advance
against it, were answered before they could have been thought
out. To add to this, there was an earnestness in his manner
that made you see his whole soul, as it were, bent upon your
spiritual good. His holiness of life, which report published
before him, and one look was enough to convince you of its
being true, compelled you to set a value on what he said, far
above the <i>dicta</i> of ordinary priests.
</p>
<p>
His style was formed on the Gospel. He loved the parables
and the similes of Our Lord, and rightly judged that the
style of his Divine Master was the most worthy of imitation.
So far as the matter of his discourses were concerned, he
was inimitable; his manner was peculiar to himself, deeply
earnest and touching. He abstained from the rousing,
thundering style, and his attempts that way to suit the taste
and thus work upon the convictions of certain congregations,
showed him that his fort did not lie there. The consequence
was, that when the words of what he jocosely termed a
"crack" preacher would die with the sound of his own voice,
or the exclamations of the multitude, Father Ignatius's
words lived with their lives, and helped them to bear trials
that came thirty years after they had heard him.
</p>
<p>
Towards the end of his life, he became rather tiresome to
those who knew not his spirit; but it was the tiresomeness
of St. John the Evangelist. We are told that "the disciple
whom Jesus loved" used to be carried in his old age before
the people, and that his only sermon was "My little children,
love one another." He preached no more, and no less, but
kept perpetually repeating these few words. Father Ignatius,
in like manner, was continually repeating "the conversion
of England." No matter what the subject of his sermon
was, he brought this in. He told us often that it became a
second nature to him; that he could not quit thinking or
speaking of it, even if he tried, and believed he could speak
for ten days consecutively on the conversion of England,
without having to repeat an idea.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
<p>
He got on very well in the missions: he took all the different
parts as they were assigned him; but he was more
successful in the lectures than in the great sermons of the
evening. His confessional was always besieged with penitents,
and he never spared himself.
</p>
<p>
The late Cardinal, who was the chief mover in bringing
the Passionists to England, wished to have a house of the
order in the diocese of Westminster (then the London
District), to which he had been recently translated. Father
Dominic entered heartily into the project, and Father Ignatius
with him. After a few weeks' negotiation, they took possession
of Poplar House, in the west end of Hampstead, towards
the end of June, 1848. A new foundation was, in those days,
as it is still, a formidable undertaking. The ground has
generally to be bought; a church and house built upon it;
the necessary machinery to set it going to be provided, and
all this from nothing but the Providence of God, and the
charity of benefactors. Under a more than ordinary
pressure of their difficulties, the house was opened, and after
many changes and removals, it has finally fixed itself on the
brow of Highgate Hill, under the name of St. Joseph's
Retreat.
</p>
<p>
He notes in his Journal that the place in Hampstead
brought some sad thoughts into his mind, as it was within
sight of where his sister, Lady Georgiana Quin, died in
1823. He tells us also that he was benighted somewhere in
London, and had to beg for a bed for the first time in his
life. On a fine summer's day he sauntered leisurely through
the grounds of Eton, ruminating over the scenes of forty
years before, when he first became a child of what proved to
him a novercal institution.
</p>
<p>
He was not destined to labour much, this time, for the
London house. Father Dominic took the charge of it, and
appointed Father Ignatius Rector of St. Michael's, Aston
Hall, a post that became vacant by the death of Father
Constantine. Father Ignatius thus mentions the matter in
one of his letters:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It was just such a death as one might
  expect of him (Father Constantine). I was thinking and
  saying to some one before, he would be attending to his
  duties and giving directions in the house to the last. In his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
  agony, he heard the clock strike, and, mistaking the hour for
  another when some bell has to ring, he asked why the bell
  did not ring for such a duty. It is recorded that what was
  most remarkable in him was his gentleness and patience;
  and that indeed was very striking. He must have suffered
  heavily to die in a lingering way by a cancer, but he never
  was disturbed, and went on saying mass, and doing all
  that was to be done, as long as he could stand to it. His
  loss makes, as you have heard, a great change in my position.
  I never dreamt of being a Superior for years to come, and
  thought I had come to an end, almost for life, of keeping
  accounts and ruling household affairs. But God's will be
  done. It is a great comfort, as I find, to be in the rule
  of good religious, to what it would be to have people
  under one who seek their own gain and pleasure."
</p>
<p>
Ruling, even thus, did not turn out so easy a matter; for it is
recorded in the Journal, that Father Dominic gave him "a
long lecture about the proper way of ruling," which he seems
to have drawn down upon himself by some mistakes.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning of September, this year, he gave his
first retreat. It was to the students of Carlow College.
This event gave him a fresh start in his great work. Since
1844, when he made the tour on the Continent, procuring
prayers for England, his zeal in the cause seems to have
slumbered somewhat. Not that he was the less anxious for
the return of his countrymen to the faith of their fathers,
but he did not, perhaps, see any opportunity open for moving
others in a general way to help the work by their prayers.
It is rather a wonderful disposition of Providence that his
energies should be renewed in Ireland, and that, too, in '48.
Extracts from a few letters will show how it happened. In
a letter to Mrs. Canning, he says:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My last journey to Ireland was, in the first place, to
  preach a retreat in Carlow College, which was the first and
  only retreat I have been on alone; secondly, to beg in
  Dublin for our church and house; thirdly, I got full into
  the pursuit of prayers for England again. I had hardly expected
  anything could be done in this last way under the
  excited state of feelings in Ireland against England. I began,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
  however, speaking in a convent in Carlow, and so warm and
  beautiful was the way in which these nuns took it up, that
  I lost no occasion after of saying mass in some convents
  every morning, and preaching to them upon it; and the zeal
  which they showed has given me a new spring to push it on
  in England. Accordingly, I have been preaching many
  times on it since I have been this time in Lancashire. I
  only ask now <i>one Hail Mary</i> a day to be said by every
  Catholic for the conversion of England. Here is a great
  field to work upon. You want to be doing something for
  England, I know; why not take up this object, and in every
  letter you write abroad or at home make people promise to
  do this, and make every man, woman, and child do it too.
  If millions would do as much as this, we should have thousands
  who would offer themselves up as victims to be immolated
  for the object, and we should have grand results.
  Above all, let it be done in schools at home; so that all the
  young may be trained to pant for this object, as young
  Hannibal for the destruction of Rome; and a foundation
  will be laid for the work to go on after we are all dead, if no
  fruit appears before."
</p>
<p>
In a letter to Father Vincent, he writes almost in the same
strain:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My journey to Ireland was satisfactory in several
  respects to a certain degree. It answered well for begging
  purposes. With all their poverty, they are so generous that
  I made one of my best week's begging in Dublin. I hope
  for a great deal more in November, when I am going again
  to preach in Dublin, and will stay as long as I can. I picked
  up also one novice, not a cleric, but, I hope, a very promising
  lay brother. I think there will be many good subjects for
  us in Ireland, when we are better known there.' (In this
  his expectations were most signally realized.) "I also got
  into the pursuit of prayers for England again. I said mass,
  and preached after mass ten times in convents on the subject,
  and the zeal and charity with which it was taken up by the
  good religious quite gave me a new spring in that cause. I
  have begun preaching in England for prayers. Will you
  help me in this? I have been writing, with Father
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
  Dominic's approval, to our General, to obtain some indulgences
  for those who will join in those prayers."
</p>
<p>
In this year, Father Ignatius lost two great friends by
death, Dr. Gentili and the Rev. Wm. Richmond. He had
several conversations with the former, who was then giving
his last mission in Dublin, and assisted on his return to
England, at the death-bed of Mr. Richmond. He used to relate
how this worthy man became a Catholic, as an instance
of the ways of God in conversion. When Richmond was a
boy, he went to see an uncle of his, who was a priest. One
day he saw candles lit in the church in clear daylight. On
entering, to satisfy himself that nothing was wrong, he saw
his uncle issuing from the sacristy, in the most fantastic garb
he ever beheld. He ran out of the church in a fright, and
scarcely came near his uncle for three days. He did sum up
courage enough to approach at length, and the end was that
he became a priest himself, and outshone his uncle.
</p>
<p>
During the visit Father Ignatius paid to Ireland, according
to promise, in the November of this year, he preached in
several places on the conversion of England. He went to
Maynooth, and addressed the junior students at night prayer
and the seniors at morning prayer, on the same subject. He
remains nearly a month in Ireland this time. He meets a
few secular people who are not so kind and generous in
listening to him as nuns and students. One day he begged
of a gentleman, who immediately began to grope in his
pocket for a coin which he should consider worthy of offering.
Whilst the search was going on, Father Ignatius ventured
to ask prayers for the conversion of England. "England!"
said the gentleman; "I pray for England! Not I." And
he turned off with a refusal, and left his petitioner to find
another benefactor.
</p>
<p>
When he returned to England, he preached everywhere,
to priests, nuns, and people; he wrote and spoke continually
for prayers for England. The only change in his system
since the former crusade was, that the prayer he asked for
was defined. It was only <i>one Hail Mary</i> daily. This
prayer he was especially fond of using; he said it for every
person and everything. The antiphon of the Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
"Rejoice, Virgin Mary, thou alone hast destroyed all
heresies throughout the world," was continually in his heart.
The devotion of the people of Ireland to our Blessed Lady
brought this out; and it was remarked by himself and
others, that when once he had put the great object of his
endeavours under the protection of Mary, he never cooled
or slackened, but always progressed with blessings.
</p>
<p>
The last day of this year was spent as all such days of his
life, since he turned thoroughly to God's service, in being
awake and in prayer at midnight.
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
<br>
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br>
A Peculiar Mission.
</h2>
<br>
<p>
Father Ignatius had an idea in his mind for a number of
years, and saw no practical way in which it might be
realized. He looked forward, with a pleasing anticipation,
to the prospect of going about from parish to parish on a
kind of itinerary mission. The thing was unusual in our
day, and he saw no plea by which it could be justified to
others, or he should have gone on it long before. He proposed
it at last to his Superiors, and the circumstances of his
position wonderfully favoured its prosecution.
</p>
<p>
Voluntary poverty was raised to a virtue by the example
and teaching of our Divine Lord, and poverty must always
have a counterpart. To be poor is to be dependent, and
want is ordained for the sanctification of plenty. When
our Divine Master said that it was difficult for the rich man
to be saved, He subjoined that with God all things are possible.
The miseries of the poor are the channels through
which riches can flow into Heaven, and make friends to
their possessors of the mammon of iniquity.
</p>
<p>
In the dispensation of Providence, the Church watches
over the interests of all her children, and whilst she proclaims
the severity of the Gospel maxims, she provides for
their observance. She must preach poverty of spirit, from
the text of the sermon on the Mount, and she manages to
make kings who are richer than David live after God's own
heart. The beautiful harmony between rank and lowliness,
authority and submission, prosperity and adversity, has long
ago been arranged by the practice of the ages of faith, and
by the Pontifical constitutions which impress the seal of the
Fisherman upon the usages of Catholicity.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
<p>
In no department of Catholic polity is this superior
wisdom so well exemplified as in the rules of mendicant
orders. The Church takes the noble from his seat of power,
she makes him cast his coronet at the feet of Peter, and
stretch out his hand to his former vassal for the paltry
morsel that is to sustain his future existence. She forbids
him to accumulate; she makes him give back a thousand-fold
what he receives. By thus bringing down the pride
of power and making it pay court to the discontented
child of penury, she reconciles man with Providence and
suffuses reverence through the crowd, who might grumble
at greatness, by making their lord according to the world
their servant according to the Gospel.
</p>
<p>
The constitutions of the Congregation of the Passion are
framed upon the spirit of the Church. If a man of property
joins our poor institute, he cannot bring his possessions with
him to enrich the community he enters; for Blessed Paul
has not allowed them to have any fixed revenue. He may,
indeed, give a donation towards the building of their church,
the furnishing of their poor schools, or the paying off the
debts they were obliged to contract to secure the ground
upon which their monastery is built; but that is left to his
own charity. He is supposed by our rule to hand over his
property to a relative or a charitable institution, and reserve
to himself the right to take it back, in case he may not persevere
in his vocation, or abandon the life he has embraced.
</p>
<p>
Thus deprived of stable funds, we are to rely upon the
Providence of God; and we can give Him glory by confessing
that we never yet found His word to fail, "Seek ye first
the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these things
shall be added unto you." Betimes we may have to send a
brother to ask for some assistance from kind benefactors;
but, as a rule, God inspires many to befriend us without
our asking. The duties of missions and retreats, and the
preparation for them, prevent us from digging a livelihood
out of the earth; but the sweat of our brow that is thus
spent earns our bread by procuring us friends. People
crowd to our churches, and leave thank-offerings there to
prove the reality of their devotion; and, as an ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">{370}</a></span>
father of ours once said, "our support comes in through the
choir-windows."
</p>
<p>
When we have to build a church or a house, we must
follow the custom of surrounding priests; but, as our working
is not purely local, we send a father or brother to distant
countries, and try not to be too burthensome to our neighbours.
Charity endureth all things; but the branch of
charity which is exercised in the giving of alms is not
always content to be too much importuned, or called upon
too often. Charity therefore requires that those who plead
for the exercise of one arm do not strain the other, and it
makes provision against provoking anger or ill-feeling from
the weaknesses it tries to cure by stirring to activity.
</p>
<p>
In the year 1848 the fathers at Aston Hall stood in sore
need of a church. Hitherto they had turned a room upstairs
into a temporary chapel; and, inconvenient as it might be
to have people going so far into a religious house, they
would have borne up longer, had not a builder told them
that anything like a crowd would bring the whole place
down about their ears. Father Ignatius mentions this in a
letter he wrote to Mrs. Canning. "It will," he says, "be a
great addition to us to have a respectable church, instead of
our chapel up-stairs; but we should not have had a plea for
asking for it, if this chapel had not been so good as to give
us notice to quit, by becoming cracky a little."
</p>
<p>
Here, then, was an opportunity. Some one should go out
and beg. Father Ignatius was commissioned to write letters,
but though the first was answered by a cheque for 100,
with a promise of more, there was not enough forthcoming
to enable them to build. Could he not do two things at
once? Could he not ask for prayers as well as alms? Did
not the very plea of begging give him a right to go to different
places, even from parish to parish, and speak publicly
and privately? It did. And he was forthwith sent out to
carry into execution the dreams of half a life, which he
scarcely ever expected to realize. He first began this peculiar
mission of his by going through the towns with a guide,
like ordinary questers: in a few years the plan developed
itself into the "little missions."
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
<p>
His first begging tour was through Birmingham, Derby,
Nottingham, Oscott, Leamington, and Wolverhampton. In
a few months he sallies forth again, and Liverpool is the
theatre of his labours. Many and rude were the trials he
had to endure in this humiliating work. He thus playfully
alludes to some of them:
</p>
<p class="cite">
"I am on a begging mission here
at Liverpool, in which I find rough and smooth, ups and
downs, every day. The general result is very fair. I have
been here since Monday, the 8th of May" (he writes on the
20th), "and have got more than 100, but with hard walking.
I am, however, quite well, and the inflammation of
my eye quite gone&mdash;nothing left but a little haziness. It
lasted five weeks without relenting at all. If it had gone
on, I must have stayed at home; but it just began to improve
before I started, and has got well, <i>tout en marchant</i>.
My present life is very pleasant when money comes kindly;
but when I get refused, or walk a long way and find every
one out, it is a bit mortifying. That is best gain for me, I
suppose, though not what I am travelling for. ....
I should not have had the time this morning to write to
you, had it not been for a disappointment in meeting a
young man, who was to have been my begging-guide for
part of the day; and so I had to come home, and stay till it
is time to go and try my fortune in the enormous market-house,
where there are innumerable stalls with poultry, eggs,
fruit, meat, &amp;c., kept in great part by Irish men and women,
on whom I have to-day, presently, to go and dance attendance,
as this is the great market-day. I feel, when going
out for a job like this, as a poor child going in a bathing
machine to be dipped in the sea, <i>frisonnant</i>; but the Irish
are so good-natured and generous that they generally make
the work among them full of pleasure, when once I am in
it."
</p>
<p>
One sees a vast difference between begging of the rich and
of the poor. If the latter have nothing to give, they will at
least show a kind face, and will not presume to question the
priest about his business; whereas some of the former,
because they have something which they will not give,
either absent themselves or treat the priest unkindly for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
asking. For what? Because he begs. It is not for himself:
he even retrenches necessaries from his own table in
order to spare something for the house of God. And what,
after all, does he ask? The price of an hour's recreation, or
an extra ornament, that may be very well spared. That is
all. The priest wants people to look after their own interests,
to send their money before them to heaven, instead of wasting
it on vanity or sin. And because he does this, and
humbles himself for the sake of his God, he must be made to
feel it. Father Ignatius was keenly alive to this, and the
way he felt for those who forgot themselves by sending him
away empty was far more afflictive than the personal humiliation.
He could thank God for the latter, but he could
not do so for the former.
</p>
<p>
Once he was fiercely abused, when begging, and as the
reviler had come to a full stop in his froward speech, Father
Ignatius quietly retorted: "Well, as you have been so
generous to myself personally, perhaps you would be so kind
as to give me something now for my community." This had
a remarkable effect. It procured him a handsome offering
then, as well as many others ever since.
</p>
<p>
Another day he knocked at a door, and was admitted by a
very sumptuously attired footman. Father Ignatius told
the servant the object of his visit, his religious name, and
asked if he could see the lady or gentleman of the house.
The servant strode off to see, and in a few seconds returned
to say that the gentleman was out, and the lady was engaged
and could not see him, neither could she afford to help him.
He then remarked that perhaps she was not aware that he
was the Honourable Mr. Spencer. The servant looked at
him, bowed politely and retired. In a minute or two Father
Ignatius hears a rustling of silks and a tripping of quick
steps on the stairs. In came my lady, and what with blushings
and bowings, and excuses and apologies, she scarcely
knew where she was until she found herself and him tte--tte.
She really did not know it was he, and there were so
many impostors. "But what will you take, my dear sir?"
and before he could say yea or nay she rung for his friend
the footman. Father Ignatius coolly said, that he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
then stand in need of anything to eat, and that he never
took wine; but that he did stand in need of money for a
good purpose, and if she could give him anything in that
way he should be very glad to accept it. She handed him a
five-pound note at once, expressing many regrets that something
or other prevented its being more. Father Ignatius
took the note, folded it carefully, made sure of its being
safely lodged in his pocket, and then made thanksgiving in
something like the following words: "Now, I am very sorry
to have to tell you that the alms you have given me will do
you very little good. If I had not been born of a noble
family, you would have turned me away with coldness and
contempt. I take the money, because it will be as useful to
me as if it were given with a good motive; but I would advise
you, for the future, if you have any regard for your soul, to
let the love of God, and not human respect, prompt your
alms-giving." So saying, he took his hat and bid his benefactress
a good morning.
</p>
<p>
Many were the anecdotes he told us about his begging
adventures; but it is next to impossible to remember them.
In every case, however, we could see the saint through the
veil his humility tried to cast over himself. Whether he
was received well or ill, he always tried to turn his reception
to the spiritual benefit of those who received him. He
made more friends than any person living, perhaps, and
never was known to make an enemy; his very simplicity
and holiness disarmed malice. He says, in a letter, upon
getting his first commission to go and quest: "I am to be a
great beggar!" His prognostication began to be verified.
Strange fact, the Honourable George Spencer a beggar!
And happier, under all the trials and crosses incident to
such a life, than if he had lived in the luxury of Althorp.
Religion is carrying out to-day what its Founder began
eighteen hundred years ago. He left the kingdom of heaven
to live on the charity of His own creatures.
</p>

<br>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br>
Death Of Father Dominic.</h2>
<br>
<p>
We group the incidents of this chapter around this sad
event: some of them were the last these two bosom friends
did together, and the others were occasioned by their
separation.
</p>
<p>
Early in January, 1849, Father Ignatius went, at the
invitation of Mr. John Smith, of Button, to see a spot of
ground upon which that worthy man intended building a
church and house for a community of Passionists. Father
Ignatius did not like the situation; but as soon as he spoke
to Father Dominic about it, they both came to St. Helen's
Junction to see if two heads might not be wiser than one.
Father Dominic landed on the platform a little before
Father Ignatius, who had been delayed somewhere on the
way. He went immediately to look for the great benefactor.
A fine-looking, open, plain man saluted him, and he
thought this must be a Catholic, and likely he knows the
person I am looking for. "Do you know where lives a
certain Mr. Smith?" asked Father Dominic. "I should
think I did," answered his new friend, and after a few
minutes' conversation the father was satisfied, for he was
no other than Mr. Smith himself. They both walked over
a considerable extent of ground, within which Mr. Smith
told the good father to make his choice of a site. He had
selected that whereon St. Anne's Retreat now stands, when
Father Ignatius arrived. Father Ignatius hesitated a
little before giving his consent, and it was only when Father
Dominic said emphatically, "The house that is to be built
here will yet be the largest and best we shall have in England,"
that he fully agreed. That prophecy is noted in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">{375}</a></span>
journal Father Ignatius kept at the time, and he wondered
afterwards how the church and monastery that arose on
that dreary spot verified it to the letter. It is the best and
largest we have in England at the present moment, and
Father Dominic never saw a stone of its foundations laid.
</p>
<p>
Fathers Dominic, Ignatius, and Vincent, give a mission
in Romney Terrace, Westminster, in March. Shortly
after they give another in High Street, Dublin. At this
mission they introduced the Italian ceremonies, such as
peacemakers (persons appointed to reconcile those at
variance), special sermons for different classes of people,
bell for the five <i>paters</i>, and public asking of pardon by the
missionaries. It fell to Father Ignatius to be spokesman
in this latter ceremony, and sore straitened was he to find
out in what particular the fathers had offended, that he
might therefrom draw the apology for their act. He
searched and searched, and at last remembered his own
proneness to nod asleep when too long in the confessional.
This was the plea he made, and we must say it was a very
poor one: it gives, however, a good idea of his candour,
and want of unreality. These demonstrations were found
to be unsuited to the genius of the people, and have been
suffered to fall into desuetude ever since.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius goes next on a begging tour through
Manchester, Sheffield, and the north of England. He called
at Carstairs House, on his way to Glasgow and Edinburgh,
to visit his friend Mr. Monteith. Mr. Monteith was received
into the Church by Dr. Wiseman, when Father
Ignatius lived in Oscott. Father Ignatius was his god-father.
A friendship then began between them which
never cooled; they kept up a correspondence from which
many important hints have been borrowed for this book,
and it was from Mr. Monteith's place the soul of Father
Ignatius took its departure for a better world. Mr. Monteith
extended the friendship he had for Father Ignatius to
his other religious brethren, and time after time has he
given them substantial proofs of its depth and generosity.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius and he had been for some time in
correspondence about founding a house of Passionists
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
somewhere near Lanark or Carstairs; but circumstances over
which they had no control prevented them coming to a
conclusion. The Vincentians have well and worthily taken
the place, and the first house of our order founded in Scotland
was St. Mungo's, Glasgow, a few months after Father
Ignatius's death. It was he who opened Mr. Monteith's
domestic chapel, and said the first mass in it. And it was
in the same chapel the first mass was said for his own soul
in presence of the body.
</p>
<p>
He says in the Journal:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Tuesday, Aug. 14.&mdash;</span> Went to
  London with Father Dominic. We had a fine talk with
  Dr. Wiseman. We dined at 12 in King William Street
  with Faber and the Oratorians.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Wednesday, Aug. 15.&mdash;</span> Sung mass at 10 and preached,
  Prepared in a hurry for my journey. Went off at 3 for
  the Continent."
</p>
<p>
He never saw Father Dominic in the flesh again.
</p>
<p>
On the 27th of August, 1849, Father Dominic and a
brother priest were travelling by railway to Aston. In the
morning, before leaving London, the companion asked
Father Dominic to bring him with him; he had just
arrived from Australia, and wished to see some of his old
companions at Aston Hall. Father Dominic thought this
was not reason enough for incurring the expense of the
journey; he demurred, but at length assented. It was fortunate
he did. When they came as far as Reading, Father
Dominic became suddenly ill. He was taken out on the
platform, and as the people were afraid of an epidemic, no
one would admit the patient into his house. There lay the
worn-out missionary, who had prayed and toiled so long for
the conversion of England, on that bleak desolate-looking
platform, abandoned by all for whose salvation he thirsted,
with only a companion kneeling by his side to prepare him
for eternity. But the coldness and want of hospitality of
the people gave him no concern: other thoughts engrossed
him. A few minutes he suffered, and in those few he made
his preparation. He made arrangements for the government
of our houses, he gave his last instructions to his companion,
he invoked a blessing upon England, and then placidly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
closed his eyes for ever upon this wicked world, to open
them in a brighter one. He died abandoned, and almost
alone, but he died in the poverty he had practised, and the
solitude he loved.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius was in Holland at the time. On his
arrival at our house in Tournay he heard a rumour of Father
Dominic's death. He gave no credit to it at first; a letter
written to him about it went astray; and it was not until
about a fortnight after it happened that he saw a paragraph
in a newspaper, giving the full particulars. He hastened
home at once to England, and the first thing he heard from
Dr. Wiseman was that Father Dominic had nominated him
his successor.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius, when his provisional appointment had
been confirmed in Rome, could only look forward to trials
and difficulties such as he had never to get through before.
We had then three houses of the order in England, and one
in Belgium, which were united under one Superior, acting
as Provincial. The houses were not yet constituted into a
canonical province. The fewness of the members, and their
ignorance of the customs and ways of a strange country,
increased the difficulties. That year, indeed, four excellent
priests, who have since worked hard on the English mission,
came from Rome; but they could as yet only say mass, on
account of their imperfect acquaintance with the English
language.
</p>
<p>
Then, the existence of each house was so precarious that
the smallest gust of opposition seemed sufficient to unpeople
them. Aston Hall was struggling to build a church, in
which undertaking that mission was destined to exhaust all
the life it had; for it eked out but a dying existence from
the time the church was opened, until it was given up in a
few years. The retreat at Woodchester seemed to have
lacked any spirit of vitality from the absence of the cross
in its foundation. The generosity of a convert made everything
smooth and convenient in the beginning, but the
difficulties that led at length to our leaving it were already
threatening to rise. The house in London was doomed to
be transplanted to the wilderness of The Hyde, even before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
the death of Father Dominic, and St. Anne's, Sutton, was
not yet begun.
</p>
<p>
This was the material position of the Passionists when
Father Ignatius became Superior, or <i>quasi</i> Provincial. To
add to this, the fathers were not first-rate men of business.
They could pray well, preach and hear confessions, but they
gave people of the world credit for being better than they
were. Some of their worldly affairs became, therefore,
complicated, and Father Ignatius, unfortunately, was not
the man to rectify matters and put them straight. He was
a sage in spirituals, but the very reverse in temporals.
</p>
<p>
Many of the religious became disheartened at the prospect.
Some lost their vocations. Many fought manfully with
contending difficulties, weathered all the storms, and, tempered
and taught by those days of trouble, look with smiling
placidity on what we should think serious crosses in these
days. Such is the beginning of every religious institute; it
grows and thrives by contradiction and persecution. Human
foresight prophesied our destruction then, and could
not believe that in sixteen years we should have seven
houses in this province, with an average of about twenty
religious for each. The ways of God are wonderful.
</p>
<p>
This kind of confession was necessary, in order that readers
might have an idea of Father Ignatius's position after the
death of Father Dominic.
</p>
<p>
He set to work at once, first carrying out Father Dominic's
intentions, and then trying some special work of his own.
The new church at Woodchester was consecrated by Dr.
Hendren and Dr. Ullathorne, and Dr. Wiseman preached
at the opening. The new church of St. Michael's, Aston
Hall, was opened in the same year. On the 7th of November
the community of Poplar House, two priests and a lay
brother, move to The Hyde.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius, with Fathers Vincent and Gaudentius,
give a mission in Westminster, and they venture out in
their habits through the streets of London. This mission
brought out some of Father Ignatius's peculiarities. In the
instruction upon the sanctification of holy days, which it was
his duty to give, he proposed that the Irish should make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>
"a general strike, not for wages, but for mass on festivals." He
went to visit Father Faber, who was ill at the time; they
became engrossed in conversation, when Father Ignatius
looked at his watch and said he should get away to prepare
his sermon or instruction. Father Faber said this was a
very human proceeding, and was of opinion that missionaries
should be able to preach like the Apostles, without preparation.
Father Ignatius turned the matter over in his
mind, reasoned it out with himself, and thenceforward never
delivered what might be called an elaborate discourse.
</p>
<p>
It may be remarked, before closing the chapter, that
Father Dominic, at Father Ignatius's suggestion, ordered, in
the beginning of 1849, three Hail Marys to be said by us
after Complin for the conversion of England. The practice
is still continued, and has been extended to our houses on
the Continent and in America.

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br>
Spirit Of Father Ignatius At This Time.</h2>
<br>
<p>
So much has to be said about the exterior actions of Father
Ignatius, that one is apt, in reading them, to forget the spirit
in which they were done. It is true that it is by the nature
of the actions themselves a judgment can be formed of what
that spirit must have been, but then they are liable to a
false construction.
</p>
<p>
He was chiefly remarkable for his spirit of poverty. It
was not alone that he loved poverty, and tried to observe his
vow, but he refined this observance to an exquisite degree,
by trying to treat himself and get others to treat him like a
mean beggar. He wished to feel poverty, and sought hardships
in things that were easy enough, for that end. When
he went by train he always took a third-class ticket, and
was most ingenious in his defence of this proceeding. If
some one objected to him that the third-class carriages generally
contained rough, low, ill-bred, and coarsely-spoken
fellows, he gently answered: "Yes; you may find a thick
sprinkling of blackguards there." "Whether or no," he
would say again, "the third class is the poor man's class,
and it ought to be mine." One time he was expected to
preach a grand sermon in some town or other; the lord of
the manor, a Catholic, ordered his carriage, with livery servants,
and came himself to bring him in state to the priest's
house. He waited for the good father on the platform,
looking at the doors of the different first-class carriages, and
condescending to give a glance or two towards the second.
What was his surprise when Father Ignatius, habit and
sandals and a', got out of a third. "My dear Father Ignatius,"
he half indignantly exclaimed, "why do <i>you</i> travel by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>
third class?" "Well," replied Father Ignatius, "because
there isn't a fourth."
</p>
<p>
This idea that he was a poor man and ought to live like
one he carried out in everything. He might be generally
seen with a large blue bag. This bag was not of a respectable
make or durable material; no, it was made of some kind
of drogget, like an ordinary sack, and had a thick clumsy
tape that gathered in the mouth of it, and closed it with a
big knot. When he had a long journey before him he
brought a pair of these, and tying them together put the
knot upon his shoulder, and would trudge off six or seven
miles with one dangling in front and another behind. If
somebody offered him a seat in a car or wagon, he gladly
accepted it; if not, he did without it. On this same principle
he seldom refused a meal when out; and if he wanted
something to eat, he generally went and begged for it at the
first house he came to. At home he usually washed and
mended his underclothing and stockings (the stockings, by
the way, would have blistered the hardest foot after his
mending), and whilst he was Superior he would never allow
anyone to do a menial service for him. He had a great
dread of the slightest attempt at over-nicety in a priest's
dress; it was anguish to him to see a priest, especially a
religious, with kid gloves, neat shoes, or a fashionable hat.
His own appearance might be put down as one degree short
of slovenliness. Be it remembered that this was not his
natural bent. We are told by those who knew him when a
young man, that he would walk a dozen streets in London,
and enter every hosier's shop, to find articles that would suit
his taste in style and fitting; it had been almost impossible
to please him in this respect; whereas, when a religious, he
would as soon wear a cast-off tartan as anything else, if it
did not tend to bring a kind of disrespect upon his order.
He wore for several years an old mantle belonging to a
religious who died, and would never leave it off as long as
there was room for another patch upon it, unless the Provincial
gave him strict orders to do so.
</p>
<p>
He was scrupulously exact in fulfilling the rules and
regulations of the Congregation, so much so that even in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
those cases in which others would consider themselves
dispensed, he would go through everything. It is our rule to
chant the entire of the Divine Office in choir; the rector is
supposed to give a homily or two, called <i>examens</i>, every week
to the religious. When there is not a sufficient number to
chant, of course no law human or divine would require us
to do so; and if there be not a congregation, one is not
expected, in the ordinary course of things, to preach to empty
benches. Father Ignatius was as keenly aware of the
common-sense drift of this kind of reasoning as any one
could be, but he so overcame the promptings of human
considerations, that a literal observance, in the face of
such plain exceptions, seemed his ordinary way of acting.
There are two instances in point that occurred about the
year 1849. The two priests who formed the choir of the
community at The Hyde remained in bed one night, either
from illness or late attendance at sick-calls, and Father
Ignatius was the only priest present. He chanted the whole
of matins and lauds by himself, and went through it as
formally as if there were twenty religious in choir.
Another day the priests were out, and he and two lay brothers
only remained at home; he preached them the <i>examen</i> just
the same as if the choir was full. Another time the alarum
that used to go off at one o'clock, at that time for matins,
missed. Father Ignatius awoke at three o'clock, and he
immediately sprung the rattle and assembled the religious
for matins. At half-past four the night work in choir was
over: half-past five was then the hour of rising for prime.
Father Ignatius kept them all in choir until the time, and
had the bells rung, and everything else in due order. This
does not argue a kind of unreasoning observance in him,
out of time and out of place. On the contrary, he well
knew that it was inconvenient, but he thought God would
be more glorified by it than by an exemption from what
was prescribed. One anecdote he used to relate to us convinced
us of that. He often related with particular tact
how once in Aston Hall, Father Dominic did not hear the
bell for matins. He awoke at half-past two; everything
was still. He went and sounded the rattle with a vengeance,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">{383}</a></span>
as if every sound was meant to say, "I'll give a good
penance to the brother that forgot to put up the alarum."
When he had done sounding he dropped the instrument at
the choir door, and went in with a taper to light the lamps.
What was his mortification to find all the religious just
concluding their meditation with a smothered laugh at their
Superior.
</p>
<p>
Two other tokens of his spirit at this time must be illustrated
together. He was a very cool reasoner; it might
almost be said that he scarcely ever grew hot in dispute,
and always gave his adversary's arguments due consideration.
At the same time he was far from being of a sceptical cast
of mind. If an argument approved itself to him, no matter
how trifling it might be intrinsically, he felt bound to admit
it, and adopt it, if practical, unless he could refute it
completely. Again, he had a thorough disregard of human
respect. "What will people say?" or "How will it look?"
never entered into the motives of his actions; and if it did,
he would consider himself bound to go straight and defy
them. What did he care about the opinion of the world?
It was, he knew, seldom led by sound reason, and therefore
beneath his consideration.
</p>
<p>
He found that the Oratorians began to go about in their
<i>soutanes</i>; he had a talk with Father Faber about it, and
forthwith resolved to go about in his habit. Cardinal Wiseman
approved of it, if done with prudence, and Father
Ignatius began at once. In a letter to Mr. Monteith he
says:&mdash;"I court the honour of following the Oratorians
close in this" (confining ourselves to the work of our vocation),
as I have done likewise in beginning to wear the habit."
He used to relate an amusing adventure he once had in a
train with his habit on. At a certain station a middle-aged
gentleman, with his little daughter, were getting into the
carriage which Father Ignatius had to himself, as every one
shunned his monkish company. The little girl got afraid, and
would not enter. The gentleman bravely ventured in, to
set an example to his child, but all to no avail,&mdash;the girl was
still afraid. At last the man said out loud, "Come on,
child; the gentleman won't bite!" meaning Father Ignatius.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
The child summed up courage when she heard the paternal
assurance of safety to her skin, and got to a seat. She
bundled herself up in the corner diagonally opposite the
monk, tried to appear as near the invisible as she could, and
stared wildly on the strange spectacle for a long time. Her
father got into conversation with Father Ignatius, began
deciphering the badge by means of all the Greek and Latin
he could bring to his assistance, and became quite interested
in the genial conversation of the good priest. When the
child heard her father laugh, she began to edge up near the
stranger, and, before they separated, father and child were
convinced that monks were not such frightful things as they
appeared at first sight. We shall have other adventures to
relate about his habit further on.
</p>
<p>
Another peculiar characteristic of his spirit was his great
devotion to the Blessed Virgin. He set more value on a Hail
Mary than any conceivable form of prayer. He went so
far in this, that he had to be reasoned out of its excess
afterwards by one of his companions. He did everything
by Hail Marys; he would convert England by Hail Marys;
and in the year 1850 he obtained a plenary indulgence for
the three Hail Marys for the conversion of England. When
any one asked him to pray for them, he promised a Hail
Mary. This was very praiseworthy in him, as we know how
hard it is even for some to go heart and soul into the Catholic
instinct of devotion to the Mother of God. They must have
their qualifications, and their terms, and their conditions,
as if, forsooth, she ought to be obliged to them for acknowledging
her privileges at all. The worst of it is, that
Catholics often tone down their books of devotion and
expressions to suit the morbid tastes of ultra-Protestants, or
the fastidiousness of some whitewashed Puseyite. It may be
thought prudent to do so; but it is disgraceful, mean, and
dishonourable, to say the least of it.
</p>
<p>
These are the most prominent outlines in Father Ignatius's
spirit at the time we are writing about, and if we add to
them a great devotion to the sacrifice of the mass, we shall
have his soul in a fair way before us. He never missed
celebrating, if he possibly could; and often he arrived at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
11 o'clock in the day at one of our houses, after travelling
all night, and would eat nothing until he had first said mass.
A month before he died he travelled all night from Glasgow
to London, and said mass in Highgate at 11 o'clock. He
was jaded, weak in health, but he would not lose one sacrifice:
it was of too great a value, and he had received too
many favours through it, to omit it on light grounds. This
was a life-long devotion of his, and it is the essential one
for a priest of God.
</p>
<p>
From what has been said, we can form a fair estimate of
his character as a Passionist. One is so obvious that it
requires no mention at all, and that was his zeal for the
conversion and sanctification of souls. So far did this go, that
he seemed led by it blindly and wholly. This was his weak,
or, perhaps more properly, his strong point. Go with him
in that, and you covered a multitude of sins.
</p>
<p>
Another essential was his "thanking God for everything."
This he carried so far that he became perfectly insensible to
insults, mockeries, and injuries, and yet he felt them keenly.
At one time he used to pass late at night by a lonesome lane
that led to our last house at The Hyde. He heard rumours
of some evil-disposed wretches having intended to shoot
him. One night he heard a rustling in the hedge as he was
walking on, and the thought struck him that perhaps an
assassin was lying in ambush for him. The religious asked
him what were his thoughts. "Well," said he, "I hoped
that when the bullet struck me I would have time to say,
<i>'thank God for that'</i> before I died."
</p>
<p>
From this rough sketch of his spirit it will be seen that
he had too little of the serpent, in the Gospel sense, to make
a good Superior. He was too simple and confiding for that;
he did not know how to suspect, and any one that knew how
to get into his views could do what he pleased. At the
same time, all reverenced him as a saint, and every day of
his religious life increased the estimation in which he was
held by his own brethren. This is the more valuable as it
is the private life of most men which lowers them in the
eyes of those who have the opportunity of observing them.
Father Ignatius tried always to make the subject-matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
his conversation as edifying as possible; it was withal so
beautifully interspersed with amusing anecdotes, that it
could not fail to interest all. He had a peculiar tact for relating
stories, and a wonderful memory; he was unrivalled
in his power of mimicry, and he enjoyed fun with the
greatest relish. It was the opinion of every one who knew
him intimately, that nothing came under his notice which
he could not turn to pointing the argument of a sermon or
furthering the glory of God. He christianized everything;
and did so with such grace, that the love of what he
remodelled was increased for its new aspect.
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
<br>


<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br>
His Dealings With Protestants And Prayers For Union.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The kindly feelings Father Ignatius always showed for
Protestants laid him open to the charge of a want of appreciation
for the blessings of faith, or of not hating heresy as
saints have hated it. Although his whole life and actions
amply refute either conclusion, some of the incidents of this
period of his life bring out his conduct in this respect in its
real character.
</p>
<p>
He tried to extend the benefit or plea of invincible
ignorance as widely as possible. He laboured and reasoned,
with a warmth unusual to him, to remove the notion some
Catholics have, that the majority of Protestants know they
are wrong, but from some unworthy motive will not give
up their errors. His proofs of the position he chose to
take here were not certainly the most convincing, for his
stock argument was to quote himself. It did of course
occur to him that its point could be retorted by the fact of
his becoming a Catholic for his <i>bona fides</i>; but he took up
the argument then by saying we were therefore to hope for
the conversion of England. His idea of England's apostasy
was mainly this: that the body of the people had been
swindled out of their religion by the machinations of a few
crafty, unprincipled statesmen, at the time of the Reformation.
A system of misrepresentation and false colouring
of Catholic doctrines and practices was invented and
handed down from generation to generation, which impregnated
the minds of children with the notion that Catholicity
and absurdity were one and the same thing. From this
point of view did he look at the millions who groped in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">{388}</a></span>
darkness of error, blaspheming the doctrines of Jesus Christ,
and imagining they were thereby doing Him a service. He
took then the side of pity, which always inclines one to the
lessening of faults.
</p>
<p>
He lamented nothing more than the loss of faith in England,
and he thought that a harsh, iron way of dealing with
Englishmen would close their hearts against grace altogether.
This led him to use the mildest terms he could find,&mdash;nay, the
most respectful,&mdash;in speaking of Protestants. He would
never call them "heretics," nor their ministers "parsons."
"Separated from the Church," "Church of England people,"
"Dissenters," "Clergymen," were his usual terms, and
he would often also speak of them as "our separated
brethren."
</p>
<p>
This twofold aspect of his bearing towards Protestants
certainly proceeded alike from charity and zeal. It was a
common remark with him, that we ought not to suppose
people bad and evil-disposed unless we are certain of it,
neither should we hurt their feelings by opprobrious epithets.
And if we intend to do them any good we should be the
more cautious still as to our thoughts and words. He used
to sigh when he had done speaking of the state of religion
in England, but he would immediately start up as if from a
reverie and say, "Shall we not do something to save our
poor countrymen?" So far was he from sympathizing with
the mildest form of error, that even in scholastic questions
he would always take the safer side. In his love for the
heretic, therefore, no one could ever find the least sympathy
with the heresy; or if he called the error a polite name, it
was only to gain admission to the heart it was corroding, in
order to be allowed to pluck it out. If we take into account
his great love for souls, it will seem wonderful that he did
not burst out at times into indignation against what destroyed
so many; but we must remember that such a thing
as fierce outbursts of any kind were most unsuitable to his
spirit. His love would make him try to eliminate from
those who had died external to the Church, all the formal
heresy he possibly could; and he felt special delight in the
fact that the Catholic Church forbids us to judge the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">{389}</a></span>
damnation of any particular individual as certain. But then
let us think for a moment of what he did to uproot heresy.
He spoke, he wrote, he preached, he toiled for thirty years
incessantly almost for this single object. Any one that
weighs this well will be far from judging that he had the
least sympathy with error. His kindliness, therefore, for
Protestants, and his belief that the vast majority of them
were in good faith, so far from making him sit down at ease
and enjoy his own faith, and not bestir himself unless
Protestants thrust themselves upon him to claim admission
into the fold, produced directly the opposite effect. Their
not being so bad as was generally imagined, buoyed his hope
in their speedy recovery; their being so near the truth, as
he charitably supposed, made him strain every nerve to
compel them to come across the barrier that separated them
from him.
</p>
<p>
One of the means he adopted for reuniting Protestants to
the Catholic Church laid him open to another serious charge,
which was, if possible, more groundless than the last. In
January, 1850, he began to go about and call upon Protestants
of every description&mdash;ministers of church and state
nobles and plebeians. His object was to get them all to
pray for unity. To state plainly his way of action, it was
this:&mdash;He intended to ask all Protestants "to pray for
unity in the truth, wherever God knows it to be." This, he
said, was of course to pray for conversion to Catholicism
unknown to themselves; it was taking the enemy by stratagem
in his own camp. Objections were made in different
quarters against the proposition. Some said it was not
acting fairly and candidly; he then used to qualify it by
telling them that he knew very well the truth lay in the
Catholic Church alone, and so did every Catholic, and that
if any Protestant asked him he would plainly tell him so.
Others then said, Protestants would be all praying for
proselytes to their own persuasions, for they were all in
good faith, and thought themselves in the truth. These and
sundry other objections were made to this mode of proceeding;
it was looked upon with suspicion, as savouring too
much of communication with heretics, and he never got a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">{390}</a></span>
superior to approve of it, neither was it condemned. So it
remained to the last an agitated question, which none of us
would enter into, and which himself adopted with a kind of
tentative adhesion. There was nothing wrong, certainly, in
getting Protestants to pray for unity; but then, "unity in
the truth, where God knew it to exist," was a very indefinite
thing to propose to them. Questions might be raised which
could only be answered in one way. What kind of unity?
External or internal, or both? "Where does God know the
truth to exist? Must we all put ourselves in a Cartesian
doubt for a starting-point? And so on. The only answer
could be&mdash;The Catholic Church. And might he not as well
ask them to pray for that at once? Father Ignatius was
not at all obstinate in sticking to this proposal as a theory
he might reduce to practice, it came up at times in his
conversation, and was dropped as easily.
</p>
<p>
The mistake it led to was, however, rather serious: it was
supposed that Father Ignatius looked favourably on, if he
did not entirely coincide with, a society called "The Association
for Promoting the Unity of Christendom," designated
by the letters A.P.U.C. With this society Father Ignatius
never had anything to do; he detested its principles, although
he hoped it would do good in its way. He wished it to be
confined to Protestants. One leading principle of the
A.P.U.C. was certainly somewhat akin to some of Father
Ignatius's dreams&mdash;conversions <i>en masse</i>; but his notions
and those of the Association were widely different. They
were for coming over in a great, respectable body, whose
size and standing would deserve to receive great concessions
in the way of discipline, as the condition of their surrender.
Father Ignatius was for an unconditional submission of each
individual, and could not allow any one to wait at the door
of the Church for a companion to enter with him. The <i>en
masse</i> of Father Ignatius was no more nor less, then, than
this: that the people of England should throw off their
prejudices and begin in a body to examine candidly the grounds
of the Catholic faith. He was glad that the Association
existed, because it carried out so much of his wishes; but it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
went too far for him, and in a prohibited line, when it asked
for Catholic prayers and sacrifices, and for Catholic members.
He never, therefore, gave his name to it, though often and
repeatedly solicited to do so. His greatest friend was publicly
known to be a member of the Association, and much
as he loved and honoured him, Father Ignatius had no
hesitation in saying of him, <i>in hoc non laudo</i>. Even so late
as the year '63 or '64, he received a bundle of their official
papers, with a private letter from the secretary and a number
of the <i>Union Review</i>; he was seen to scan them over,
and then throw them into the fire. About the year '50 or
'51, when he was always going about asking for prayers for
unity, after the new idea that struck him, an incident
occurred to bear out what is here said. He happened to be
speaking with a roomful of Protestant clergymen on this
very subject. They listened to him very attentively, raised
objections, had them answered, and finally agreed to the
justness of his proposals. They agreed, moreover, to kneel
down then and pray together for unity, and asked Father
Ignatius to join them. He refused at once. They pressed
him on every side, and said, among other things, that he
ought to set them this example. He jumped up with
indignation, and said, in a manner quite unusual to him, "I'd
rather be torn in pieces by forty thousand mad dogs than
say a prayer with you." He hereupon left the room, and
became more cautious for the future as to how and when he
asked them to pray for unity. The reason of this abrupt
proceeding was the law that forbids all Catholics to communicate
with heretics in divine things. Joint prayer, of course,
is against this law.
</p>
<p>
It is singular that, though he has left behind his thoughts
drawn out in full upon all the ideas he took up from time
to time about the conversion of heretics and the sanctification
of Catholics, there is nothing left among his papers
upon this project. We may conclude from this, as well as
what has been said above, that while he looked upon the
Unionists with kindness, he never adopted their principles;
and such of his notions as seemed congenial to theirs will be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
found, on examination, to be totally different. This it was
necessary to remark, as many very well informed Catholics
thought poor Father Ignatius came under the censure of the
Inquisition, <i>in re</i> A.P.U.C. It was quite a mistake, and
he should have endorsed that censure himself, if he lived,
and freely as he avoided what drew it down before he
died.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br>
Father Ignatius In 1850.</h2>
<br>
<p>
This year was so full of events interesting to Father Ignatius,
that there is no leading one round which others may
be grouped to head the chapter. He expected to be called
to Rome towards Easter; he had even written to the General,
and had received letters to that effect. The object of this
visit will be best understood from the following extract
from a letter written at this time, dated from 13, Garnault
Place, Clerkenwell, London:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I am here on a mission with
  Father Gaudentius, and as we have not yet great press of
  work, I will write to tell you of an important feature in
  my prospects for the present year. It is, that I am going
  to Rome about Easter. About the time I saw you last I
  wrote to the General, saying that I thought this would be a
  good step. After that I thought no more about it till the
  other day a letter came from him, in which he approved the
  proposal; and so, after a mission which we are to give at
  St. George's from the first to the fourth Sunday in Lent, I
  propose starting. I shall be, I expect, about four months
  absent. I propose begging my way there, through France
  or Germany, which will make the journey last a month or
  six weeks; then, after stopping six weeks or two months in
  Italy, to make acquaintance with our Senior Fathers, and
  inform myself, as much as possible, of all the ways and
  spirit of our congregation (of which, of course, now I am
  very ignorant), I hope to bring back the General with me
  to make a visitation of his flock."
</p>
<p>
Before giving the mission in St. George's, he wrote to his
sister, Lady Lyttelton, to tell her of his intended journey to
Rome, and of a visit he would pay her before starting. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
ladyship was then in Windsor Castle, and we shall give her
reply, as it shows the genial affection that always existed
between them, and at the same time accounts for his not
having gone to Windsor in his habit, as was often supposed.

<br><br>
  "My Dear Brother,&mdash;I am very much obliged to you
  for your kindly telling me your plans, and giving me a hope
  of seeing you before you go to Rome. The period you
  mention as the probable one for your mission at St. George's,
  will most likely be the very best for me to see you, as we
  shall probably remove to London about the middle of February,
  and remain till after Easter; so I shall look forward with
  much pleasure to an occasional visit. I am much obliged to
  you for telling me of the intended change in your dress.
  I should never have guessed its probability, having erroneously
  believed it simply illegal; but I find that was a
  mistake. You will, I hope, not wonder or blame me, if I
  beg you to visit me at my own little home, No. 38, St.
  James's Place, and not at the Palace, when you are looking
  so remarkable. I don't want to figure in a paragraph, and
  so novel a sight in the Palace might lead to some such
  catastrophe. A day's notice of your visit will always enable
  me to meet you, and Caroline and Kitty, and probably
  others of those that remain to me of my ancient belongings,
  may thereby sometimes get a glimpse of you, though we should
  be always able to have our <i>coze</i> in a separate room. I almost
  wish you would take me under your cowl to Rome. How
  I should like once more to see the Colosseum (and to learn
  to spell its name), and the Vatican! but hardly at the cost
  of a long journey, either.

<p>
When Father Ignatius went to St. James's Place to pay
the visit arranged for in this letter, he experienced some
difficulty in getting as far as his sister. The porter who
opened the gate did not know him, and was, of course,
astonished to see such a strange figure demanding an interview
with his mistress. He would not let him in until he got
special orders from Lady Lyttelton herself. Father Ignatius
used to contrast this servant's mode of acting with that of
another who admitted him once to Althorp. This last servant
did not know him either; but seeing he looked tired,
he took him into his lodge, got him some bread and cheese
and a glass of ale for refreshment. By-and-by the Earl
passed, and was highly amused at seeing George regale himself
with such satisfaction on the servant's fare. The servant
made some apologies, but they were quite unnecessary, for
Father Ignatius never forgot his kindness, and used to say
that he enjoyed the porter's pittance far more than the viands
of the "Big House," as he used to call it.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius was seldom at home up to June, when
he went to visit our religious in Belgium, who were subject
to his jurisdiction; he had given a mission in Garnault
Street, a retreat to our religious in Aston Hall, a mission in
St. George's, Southwark, a retreat to nuns in Winchester, a
retreat to people in Blackbrook, and a retreat in Sedgley Park.
On his return from Belgium he remained in London, and
preached in different churches, besides giving a retreat to
the people in Winchester, and visiting several Protestant
ministers, until the mission in Maze Pond. This was so
badly attended that he used to preach in the courts, beating
up for an audience. In giving an account sometimes of the
visits above mentioned, he used to tell about an old minister
he and another of our fathers once called upon. This gentleman
suffered from gout, and was consequently rather
testy; he had a lay friend staying with him at the time of
the two Passionists' visit. He called the fathers idolaters,
and insisted, right or wrong, that our Lord used the word
"represent" when he instituted the Blessed Sacrament at
the Last Supper. It was in vain that all three tried to
convince him of his mistake. When, at last, the passage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
was pointed out to him, and that he had assured himself, by
inspecting title-page and royal arms, that the Bible was a
genuine authorized version, he was so far from giving in
that, like the wolf in the fable, he immediately indicted
them on another plea. This incident Father Ignatius used
to recount to show how far ignorance hindered the removal
of prejudice.
</p>
<p>
His Roman plan fell to the ground in the beginning of
July, when he received a letter to announce the coming
of Father Eugene as Visitor-General to England. Father
Ignatius went to meet him to Tournay, and escorted him
to England, where his passing visit became a fixed residence
to the present day. This happened towards the end of July.
Father Ignatius then gave retreats to the priests in Ushaw
College, to the nuns in Sunderland, and came to London to
arrange about our taking St. Wilfrid's from the Oratorians.
He went through all this before the end of August, and was
in Carlow on the 4th of September, to give two retreats at
the same time to the students of the College and the
Presentation nuns.
</p>
<p>
On the 8th of September he went to Thurles. The Irish
bishops were assembled there for the most important synod
held since Henry VIII.'s proposals were rejected. The
synod was held to make canons of discipline, and laws for the
new <i>status</i> the Church had gained in Ireland. The rough-and-ready
ceremonial that had to be used in times of persecution
was laid aside, after it had done good work in its day,
and one more systematic was decreed for the administration
of the sacraments. Here the Irish prelates were assembled,
and Father Ignatius thought it a great opportunity for opening
his mind and stating his views to Ireland by letting
them known to her hierarchy. His account of the visit
to Thurles is thus recorded in his journal:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<span class="quotehead">Sept. 8.&mdash;</span>Mass
  at 5. Railway to Thurles at 6. Put up at the
  Christian schools. Dined there at 4. Saw the Primate, &amp;c.,
  at the College. Begged of the bishops, &amp;c.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Tuesday,  Sept. 9.&mdash;</span>Mass
  at 6, at the Monk's Altar. Begged on from
  the bishops. At 10, the great ceremony of concluding the
  synod, till 2. The Primate preached. Dr. Slattery sang
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">{397}</a></span>
  mass. I walked in the procession. At 5, dined with the
  bishops, &amp;c., at the College. Made a speech after dinner
  on the Crusade."
</p>
<p>
After his visit to Thurles, he came back to Carlow and
gave a retreat to the lay students in their own oratory.
He then went off on a begging tour through Kildare, Carlow,
and Kilkenny. Whilst in Kilkenny he went to look
at the old cathedral (now in Protestant hands); his <i>cicerone</i>
was a very talkative old woman, who gave him a history, in
her own style, of the crumbling worthies whose names he
deciphered on the different monuments. One account she
told with especial gusto: the last moments of an old lady
"of the Butlers." This old lady, according to the
<i>cicerone's</i>
account, had once been a Catholic, and on her death-bed
wished to receive the rites of the Church. She was told
that if she died a Catholic, those to whom her property was
willed would be disinherited, and that the property would
pass over to others. She hesitated some time on hearing
this announcement, and after a few minutes' reflection
expressed her decision as follows, "Oh, well; it is better that
one old woman should burn in hell than that the family of
the Butlers should lose their estate." She died shortly after
&mdash;a Protestant. Father Ignatius used to say that he never
was more surprised than at the manner of his guide as she
concluded the climax of her narrative. She seemed to think
old Granny Butler's resolution showed the highest grade of
heroic virtue and self-sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
In Carrick-on-Suir he says: "Made the best day's begging
in my life up to this, 50." He then went to Tipperary,
Cork, visited all the convents and priests, came to Birr,
spent an afternoon with Lord Ross and his telescope; begs
in Limerick, Drogheda, Newry, Dundalk, Ardee, Castle-blaney,
Carrickmacross, Londonderry, Strabane, Omagh.
When he was in Omagh there was a tenant-right meeting,
and he went to hear Gavan Duffy. He begs through Dungannon,
Lurgan, Enniskillen, Ballyshannon, Clogher. He
then came to Dublin, from which he paid flying visits to a
few convents, and to the colleges of Maynooth and All-hallows.
He returned to England on the 17th of November;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
and, during his two months' tour in Ireland, he had
preached seventy-nine sermons, on the conversion of
England chiefly.
</p>
<p>
He heard of the re-establishment of the hierarchy in
England while travelling in Ireland, and one of his first acts,
on returning to London, was to pay his respects to his old
friend, the new Cardinal. This year we were put in possession
of St. Saviour's Retreat, Broadway, which has been
the noviciate of the order since. St. Anne's, Sutton, was
also colonized about the same time. Father Ignatius gave a
mission in Glasgow during this Advent, and brought two
young priests with him to train into the work of the
missions. One of them was Father Bernard, and he gives
wonderful accounts of Father Ignatius's labours. He slept
but about four hours in the twenty-four, and was all the
rest of the time busy either in the confessional or on the
platform, with the exception of the time he took to eat a
hurried meal or two.
</p>
<p>
In going through Liverpool on his return from Glasgow,
in his habit, a crowd gathered round him to hoot and insult
him. In his journal he says: "I got two blows on the
head," for which he took good care to thank God. The year
is concluded by preaching in Dublin, and giving the <i>renewal</i>
retreat to the Sisters of Mercy in Birr.
</p>
<p>
Any one that will glance over this year of his life, and
see him perpetually moving from place to place, will certainly
think he had little time to himself. It was about
this time that he made the resolution of never being a moment
idle, a resolve he carried out to the last. During this
year and the preceding he was occupied in translating into
English Da Bergamo's <i>Pensieri ed Affetti</i>. The greater part
of this book, which was published by Richardson, under the
name of <i>Thoughts and Affections on the Passion</i>, was
translated by Father Ignatius, on railway stations, while waiting
for trains, in every place, before or after dinner, in intervals
between confessions, in all kinds of out-of-the way places;
and so careful was he to fill up every moment of time that
we see noted in his journal his having done some of Da
Bergamo in the fore cabin of the steamer that took him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
from Holyhead to Kingstown. He wrote it mostly in
pencilling, on the backs of envelopes, scraps of paper of all
sizes, shapes, and quality; so that it was nearly as difficult
to put those sibylline leaves in order and copy from them as
it was to translate, if not more so. Besides this he wrote a
number of letters; and his letters were no small notes with
broken sentences, but long lectures on difficulties of
conscience, written with a care and consideration that is
perfectly surprising when one reflects upon his opportunities.
He used to say that no one should ever excuse his not
answering a letter for want of time: "If the letter is
worth answering we ought to get time for it, for it becomes
a kind of duty." He certainly had no time to spare or
throw away, but he had always enough for any purpose in
which charity or obedience could claim him. His days were
indeed full days, and he scarcely ever went to bed until
he had shaken himself out of nodding asleep over his table
three or four times. No one ever heard him say that he
was tired and required rest; rest he never had, except on
his hard bed or in his quiet grave. If any man ever ate his
bread in the sweat of his brow, it was Father Ignatius of
St. Paul, the ever-toiling Passionist.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
A New Form of <br>
"The Crusade."</h2>
<br>
<p>
We find Father Ignatius, at the beginning of the year 1851,
begging in Ireland. It was not his custom to go regularly
from house to house; he preferred collecting people together,
and addressing them, and, if this were not practicable, getting
permission from the priests to speak to their flocks on
Sundays and festivals. He wanted prayers more than money,
and he was delighted that the plea of begging justified his
moving about, and gave him a kind of faculty to preach on
his favourite topic, "the conversion of England." Oftentimes
the spiritual interfered with his temporal interests, as
when an Irishman, who was about to give him an alms,
refused it as soon as he spoke about England. Strange
enough, Father Ignatius thought England-hating Irishmen
the very best subjects to practise his art of persuasion on.
He thought them true souls, sensitive of their wrongs, and
valued them far more than those who lauded England
through lack of patriotism.
</p>
<p>
He met many adventures during this begging tour in Ireland.
In one parish, the priest promised to allow him to
preach to his congregation on the Sunday, and collect from
them. The priest did not seem to possess indifference to
earthly things, or generosity either, in a very high degree;
for, when Father Ignatius came to his place on Saturday,
his reverence told him that he intended to claim the collection
in the church, whilst Father Ignatius might stand at
the door and beg for himself as the people were going out.
Father Ignatius thanked God, and was content, only remarking
that, with the priest's permission, he would prefer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
to hold his hat under a large tree that grew near the
church-door, instead of at the door itself.
</p>
<p>
He preached at the last mass, and never said a word about
where or when he was to receive the people's offerings; the
collection was made by the priest, and a most miserable one
it proved to be. Father Ignatius held his hat under the
tree, and, since the day in Carrick-on-Suir, never had such
a collection. It was a marvel to him; he could not account
for it, and he was the more surprised when he compared
notes with the parish priest after all was over. He found
out the solution of the mystery that same evening. It
seems that, on Saturday, he told a respectable lady in the
neighbourhood of the priest's decision. She, without telling
him a word of what she intended doing, went home, sent
her servant through the village, and collected twelve stalwart
active young men; she harangued them on what the
priest was about to do, and sent them all off to different
parts of the parish to tell the people of it, and also of the
spot where Father Ignatius would receive their offerings.
The people had reason to think their pastor was a little fond
of money, and their indignation at his proceeding helped to
increase their liberality.
</p>
<p>
He begged at this time in Borris O'Kane, Limerick, Ennis,
Gort, Galway, Loughren, Ballinasloe, Mullingar, and preached
101 sermons since the previous 5th September. His begging
tour ends in Dublin, about March, where he begins a new
campaign of what he terms "his crusade."
</p>
<p>
He preached some controversial lectures in Dublin, dined
and talked with Dissenting ministers, wrote a little newspaper
controversy, and had a meeting in the Rotundo. This very
active kind of work did not seem to suit his taste or spirit,
and he changed very soon to another and a more congenial
one&mdash;the conversational mode of advancing the Catholic
cause.
</p>
<p>
He visited the leading men both in the Establishment
and in the offices of State, and the conferences he held with
them are so interesting that we shall relate a few of them
in his own words. The extracts are taken from letters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
published by him in 1853, in the <i>Catholic Standard</i>, now
<i>The Weekly Register</i>:&mdash;

  <i>Interview with Lord John Russell.</i>
<br><br>
  One day early in February, 1850, I had been on an expedition
  down to Westminster. I look back on all my walks
  during a certain period, that is, while I was constantly
  wearing my Passionist habit, as <i>expeditions</i>. Indeed they
  were eventful ones in their way. I was returning through
  Parliament Street; and having an hour to dispose of, as I
  passed by Downing Street, I thought I would now try,
  what I had long thought of, to have a conversation with the
  Premier. I asked, "Is Lord John Russell at home?"
  The messenger [query?] who came to the door looked at my
  figure with some surprise, then said, "Yes, sir, but he is
  engaged at present?" I said, "Will you be so good as to
  say to him that Lord Spencer's brother would wish to
  speak with him?" "Walk in, sir," he answered; and to
  my surprise, I must say, I found myself at once in a waiting-room,
  and five minutes later was introduced to Lord John.
  He rose to me, and kindly pointed to a chair. I said, "Do
  you remember me, my Lord?" "Oh, yes," he answered. I
  then proceeded: "I hardly know whether what I am now
  doing is wise or not; but I will explain my reason for asking
  to see your lordship and you will judge. You are aware,
  probably, that it is now some twenty years since I became a
  Catholic. Ever since that time, my whole mind has been
  bent on leading others to the same faith, and, in short, on
  the conversion of this country to Catholicity. For this end
  I have endeavoured, as far as it was possible, to move all
  Catholics throughout the world to pray for the conversion of
  England. I have also spoken with as many as I could of
  the leading men among the clergy of the Church of England
  and among Dissenting ministers, to move them also to pray
  that God would bring this country to unity in the truth
  wherever he sees it to be. I am almost always received
  agreeably on these occasions; for all seem to agree in what
  I think cannot be denied, that if there is anything which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">{403}</a></span>
  threatens ruin to the power and prosperity of this country
  it is our religious divisions." His lordship here, without
  speaking, intimated, as I understood, his assent to this last
  sentence; but interrupted me by asking more particularly:
  "What do you propose to Dissenters?" "The same," I
  said, "as to Anglicans; I conceive this prayer is proper for
  them all alike." ... I proceeded: "Among Catholics
  I find myself constantly met by the objection, that if they
  came forward openly, as I wish them to do, it would offend
  those in power in England. I answer them, I am convinced
  it would not; but in order to satisfy others rather than
  myself, I have at last thought it well to come to the first
  authority and ask. I will remark to your lordship why I
  say this. Among all Catholics, I am particularly intent on
  moving the Catholics of Ireland to undertake this cause. I
  first went to Ireland for the purpose in 1842. Now I look
  upon it as certain, that if the Irish had then undertaken, as
  I wished them, to pray for the conversion of England, and
  had persevered in that work out of charity, they would not,
  in 1848, have thought of making pikes against England;
  and this would have saved our Government some millions of
  pounds, perhaps. Pikes are well enough in their place, but
  I consider that charity would not have prompted the making
  of them on this occasion. Again, I will say that my favourite
  individual object in Ireland is to enlist in my cause your
  lordship's illustrious correspondent, Dr. M'Hale; and it is
  my opinion that it would improve the style of his letters if
  there were introduced into them some expressions of charity
  towards England." Lord John slightly smiled, and then
  proceeded with his answer, as follows: "In answering you,
  I beg to be understood that I do not speak as a minister;
  but I will tell what I think as an individual. The entire
  liberty which exists in this country for every one to think
  as he pleases, and to speak what he thinks, makes it appear
  to me difficult to conceive how a reunion of all the different
  religious opinions could be effected. That is at least a distant
  prospect. But anything which would tend to a diminution
  of the spirit of acrimony, and of the disposition of people of
  opposite opinions to misrepresent one another's views, must
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
  do good." Then he added, in a very pleasing tone: "And I
  will tell you, that I consider the body to which you belong
  is the one which suffers the most from such misrepresentations."
  I said then: "After hearing your lordship's answer,
  given with such kindness, I am quite happy at having come;
  and I think I may infer from what you have said, that you
  perfectly approve of my proceedings, for the tendency of
  them entirely is to remove the misapprehensions which
  exist, on both sides, of the others principles. I am convinced
  that Catholics generally have a mistaken idea of
  what respectable Protestants are; and there is no doubt
  Protestants are very widely wrong in their opinions of
  Catholics. I am working to counteract this error on both
  sides."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  To this he did not reply; and as I had gained all that I
  desired, I rose to take my leave, and said: "I frequently
  say to persons with whom I have had conversations like this,
  what I will now say to your lordship, that I do not promise
  secrecy concerning them; but I request, as a favour, that if
  they should ever hear of my making what they consider an
  improper use of anything that they have said, they would
  call me to account for it." On this sentence, likewise, he
  made no remark, but added again: "I repeat once more that
  I have not spoken as a minister, as I do not think this is a
  matter with which I have any concern in that character."
  I replied: "I understand you, my Lord; yet I will say that
  it appears to me, that I have reasons to have addressed your
  lordship in your public character." His lordship smiled,
  slightly bowed, and I withdrew.

<br>
<p class="cite">
  <i>Interview with Lord Clarendon.</i>
<br><br>
  I am very happy at finding myself with my pen in hand,
  to give an account of my interviews with another distinguished
  member of our Government; at least, as far as what
  passed bears on the subject of these letters, the enterprise
  of England's conversion:&mdash;I mean Lord Clarendon, while
  he was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. His lordship and I
  were formerly fellow-collegians and friends at Cambridge;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">{405}</a></span>
  but from the year 1819, when I left Trinity College, we
  never saw each other till November 13, 1850, when I had
  an audience from him at the Viceregal Lodge in the Phoenix
  Park, at Dublin. When I had been in Ireland in 1848,
  the thought had crossed my mind that I should be pleased
  to have a conversation with him, but I put it away as a
  strange idea, not worth entertaining. In 1850, I returned
  to Ireland, and starting from the Synod of Thurles, at the
  beginning of September, I had what I would call my grand
  campaign among the Irish people. From the beginning of
  September to the end of April, I preached 170 sermons to
  them on the enterprise of the conversion of England, which
  at that time I used to call the <i>Crusade for England</i>; besides
  a number, past reckoning, of addresses to convents and
  schools, and private conversations to the same intent. This
  career was interrupted in the middle of November, when I
  came for six weeks to England. As I was approaching
  Dublin to cross the water, my strange idea revived, but its
  aspect was more inviting. The result of my visit to Lord
  John Russell had been so encouraging, that I wrote to Lord
  Clarendon, and asked permission to pay him my respects, as
  I passed through Dublin. He sent me a very kind answer
  to the place which I had pointed out, naming an hour on the
  day named above&mdash;half-past one, November 13&mdash;at which
  time I was introduced into his private room at the Lodge.
  One of his first remarks was that circumstances were greatly
  changed with us both since our last meeting. Indeed, they
  were, as any one would have said who had seen him as
  George Villiers, of St. John's, and me as George Spencer,
  of Trinity, walking together in our college gowns, at Cambridge,
  and now should see him in his grand Viceregal
  Palace, and me before him in my poor Passionist's habit; and
  is it not something to be looked upon with satisfaction, that
  we should now have a conversation for an hour and a half, of
  which, though the matter was something far more weighty than
  what would very probably have occupied us then, the tone
  which he gave to it was such, that one might have supposed
  our familiar acquaintance had never been interrupted?
  The conversation was throughout very interesting to me;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">{406}</a></span>
  but this does not seem to me the time nor the place to relate
  what passed, excepting those passages which bore directly
  upon my present subject.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  I do not remember how, in the course of it, Lord Clarendon
  was led to say: "I see in the papers that you have
  been preaching in several places." I answered: "Yes, I
  have; and the principal object of my asking for this interview
  with your lordship, was to tell you the subject of my
  preaching, and to ask what you think of it. I am preaching
  to the Irish people a crusade for the conquest of England."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  I am not clear whether it was before saying these words,
  or after, that I related to him the conversation I had had
  with Lord John Russell in the same way in which it was
  given in my last letter. However this might be, I perfectly
  remember the way in which he replied. He appeared at
  the first moment to be surprised; then fixed upon me one
  rather searching look; and then deliberately said: "Taking
  the view of things which you do, I think you are right."
<br><br>
  * * * *
<br><br>
  Lord Clarendon, knowing that I was next day to start for
  England, concluded by most kindly expressing a wish to see
  me again, when I should be passing at some future time
  through Dublin.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  After six weeks I returned to renew my circuit in Ireland,
  and returning to Dublin about the middle of January,
  though I had no reason particularly for wishing to speak
  again with Lord Clarendon, I considered that it was in some
  way a duty of propriety to ask for an interview, as he had
  been pleased to request it at the close of the first visit.
  Accordingly, after some time for reflection, I wrote him a
  letter to this effect, and he appointed me half-past eleven on
  Saturday, February 8, 1852. This time it was in Dublin
  Castle that I saw him, being ushered into his private room
  through the muskets, bayonets, and other arms&mdash;not ancient
  pieces, for curiosity, as at Alton Towers, but arms of the
  most modern style, ready for use&mdash;with which the hall and
  great staircase seemed to me as though wainscoted throughout.
  I apologised soon after entering at taking up so much
  of his time; and again somewhat later I offered to
 <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">{407}</a></span>
  withdraw, however interesting was the conversation to myself.
  He answered, "Oh, no! I am very glad to see you. They
  will soon tell me of Sir Thomas Reddington being come for
  business: till then I am free." I will now relate only one
  or two passages of this conversation, as being, I conceive, of
  peculiar consequence to my present purpose. I was saying
  something of my continued endeavours to move the Irish to
  pray for England, and I suppose remarking that this must
  have a salutary effect on the feelings of the people. He
  said with an incredulous smile: "And do you think the Irish
  pray for England?" "I have no doubt whatever," I answered,
  "that a great many do, but it is as yet nothing to
  what I desire to bring them to." With a still more incredulous
  look, he added: "Do you think they pray for
  England at Maynooth?" "Well, my Lord,' I only know
  that whenever I visit Maynooth the superiors appoint me a
  time for addressing the students assembled (he looked
  evidently pleased at hearing this); and will you listen," I
  continued, "to a sentence of one of my half-hour's addresses
  to them? I began it without well knowing what I was
  going to say; but when I had finished I said to myself, I
  have said one good thing at least which I shall one day turn
  to account. It was soon after the publication of Lord John
  Russell's Durham letter. I said to them, 'Will you allow
  me to offer you one word of advice? You will just now be
  tempted most probably to say some violent things; especially
  some violent things of Lord John Russell. Now I would
  ask you, Do you know Lord John Russell? I suppose one
  and all would tell me <i>no</i>. The advice I was going to offer
  is that you should not speak evil of what you do not know.'"
  Lord Clarendon said: "Did you say that?" I said: "Yes,
  my lord." He added emphatically: "That <i>was</i> good." After
  I had risen to leave him, I said: "My Lord, I have been
  often citing your Excellency, since our first conversation, as
  one of those who entirely approve of my proceedings."
  "What do you mean?" he quickly answered. "Did I not
  tell you I would shed the last drop of my blood to stop the
  progress of your religion?" "I perfectly remember that,"
  I said; "what I mean is that you approved of my way of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
  acting, considering what I am." "Oh," he replied, "I
  understand you. If every one acted as you do, we should
  have nothing to complain of." This conversation lasted from
  three-quarters of an hour to an hour.

  <i>Interview with Lord Palmerston</i>.
<br><br>
  I am sometimes reminded of a story I heard of a groom,
  who had to show off one of his master's horses, which he
  wished to sell. Among all the other good qualities for which
  he had praised the animal, as he stood behind him in the
  stable, being asked by the intended purchaser, "What do
  you say of his temper?" he had just answered, "Oh, he is
  as quiet as a lamb," when the horse kicked out, struck the
  poor groom full in the pit of the stomach, and drove the
  breath out of him. But he must stand to his text, and with
  wondrous promptness he was just able to utter, "Ach&mdash;
  playful toad!" So I will have our poor people hoped for,
  prayed for, borne with and loved, with all their effigy burnings,
  with all their meetings to hear Dr. Cumming or Mr.
  Stowell, with all their awful Popery sermons, and, moreover,
  with the two or three thumps on the head, and other
  pieces of genteel treatment which I met with myself, while
  I walked about in my habit, before the Derby proclamation
  gave me some time to breathe again.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  After this preface as an apology, if it is one, for my last
  sentences of last week, and for standing to <i>my</i> text, in spite
  of all that can be urged, I proceed to another of my narratives,
  which, if not the most interesting and important in
  my eyes, is not the least so; and, after which, in reply to
  such as might mention some of the English rudenesses to
  us, and say to me, "What do you say to that?" I would
  just say, "What do <i>you</i> say to this?"&mdash;I mean my interview
  with Lord Palmerston.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  Through the month of May of the year 1851, I was
  engaged to preach evening lectures in one of the London
  chapels, and I had my days to devote in a great measure
  to the pursuit, so inconceivably interesting to me, of
  conversations with leading people on my great topic. I was at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
  that time greatly debilitated, and could walk but very little,
  and to relieve me, therefore, as well as to enable me to make
  the most of my time, a generous friend, who was interested
  in my proceedings, furnished me with means to go from
  house to house in a cab. One of these bright forenoons, I
  turned into Carlton Gardens, and asked to see Lord
  Palmerston. I was not an entire stranger to him, any
  more than to the other two noble persons of whom I have
  already written. It will not be foreign to my purpose to
  relate how my acquaintance with his lordship had been
  formed. May I venture to call it a friendship? It was at
  the close of a long run with Lord Derby's stag-hounds; I
  mean the grandfather of the present earl, I think in 1821;
  we finished, I think, twenty-four miles from London, and I
  was making up my mind for a long, tedious ride home on
  my tired horse (for I was not up to having second horses
  and grooms in my suite on those occasions), when Lord
  Palmerston, who was likewise in at, not the death, but the
  taking (I forget the proper sporting term) of the stag,
  understanding my case, and knowing me by sight, though I think
  till then we had never spoken, gave my horse in charge to
  his groom, and took me home with himself in a post-chaise.
  For the short remaining time of my being known as a young
  man about town, as we met at one party or another, Lord
  Palmerston continued to accost me with a kind word, to
  which I had good reason, it will be allowed, to respond in
  the best manner I knew how. At the close of the London
  season of 1822 I made my bow, and withdrew from that
  stage to prepare for taking orders, and, except an interview
  of a few minutes in 1834, we had never met till I appeared
  before the now far-famed and, by many, dreaded Foreign
  Secretary, with my Passionist habit and sandalled feet
  for a private audience. Like what Lord Clarendon said in
  the Park Lodge, Dublin, I might have said here, "Great
  changes, my lord, since we first spoke together!" On this
  occasion, however, no time was spent in mere conversation.
  I had called, as I have said, in the forenoon. His lordship
  had sent me a message as being busy, requesting me to call
  again at two o'clock. On entering his private room, I found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
  him engaged in looking over what seemed official papers,
  which he had upon his knee, while we spoke, though without
  the least sign of impatience or wish to get rid of me; but I
  saw that what became me was to enter on business at once
  without waste of time or words. I do not remember all the
  words which I used in this interview so well as what I said
  to Lord John Russell and Lord Clarendon. The position
  was not now so new and striking to me. I think I began
  without any kind of apology; for his lordship's looks gave
  me no feeling that any was needful or expected.
  I said, "that in coming to speak to his lordship on this
  subject, I had not so much in view to ascertain more and
  more that there was no danger of what I proposed causing
  offence to our Government, as I thought what I had heard
  from others was sufficient proof of this; but I wished to
  put as many of our public men as I could meet with in possession
  of all my intentions and proceedings, in order that if,
  at last, I succeeded, as I hoped, in moving the Catholics to
  be interested about them, and these matters came before the
  public, they might know from myself in person what I really
  intended, and might be enabled, if they thought well, to do
  me justice." This was the substance of what I said to him.
  Having thus concluded, I awaited his answer, which was
  about as follows:&mdash;"As you wish to know what I think of
  your doings, I must say I do not by any means agree with
  you in considering it a desirable result that this country
  should again be brought under subjection to Rome. I do not
  profess to take my view from the elevated and sublime
  ground on which you place yourself; I mean, I speak not
  with reference to religious interests, but to political; and as
  a politician, when we consider the way in which the Pope's
  government is opposed to the progress of liberty, and liberal
  institutions, I cannot say that I wish to see England again
  under such influence." Thus far, I do not mean to say, that
  what I heard was anything agreeable to me. Neither the
  matter nor the tone were agreeable to me. There was something
  sarcastic in his tone. And does that suit my purpose?
  it may be asked. I answer, "It does very well." Could it
  be expected that he would speak very agreeably and favourably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>
  of the end I told him I was aiming at? If he had,
  that would, I conceive, have just thrown a doubt on the
  sincerity of what he said immediately after, in a tone simply
  and perfectly agreeable, on the effect likely to result immediately
  from what I was doing: and this was: "But as to
  what you are doing, as it must tend to conciliate Catholic
  powers towards England, what have I to say, but that it is
  excellent?" or some such word expressing full and cordial
  approbation. After this, he went on with some remarks on
  the establishment of the Hierarchy, which, of course, were
  in accordance with what he had, I think, been saying a few
  days previously in Parliament, complaining of it as offensive
  and injurious; but on this part of the conversation I need
  not dwell, as it had no bearing on the subject which I had
  proposed to him. With regard to that, my impression on
  leaving him was this: that he had listened with attention to
  what I had said, had at once perfectly understood me, had
  answered me so as to make me perfectly understand him on
  the subject simply and openly, and that what he had said
  was entirely satisfactory to me. I could wish for nothing
  more; except, of course, what St. Paul wished for in the
  presence of Festus and Agrippa. I then rose: so did he;
  then shook hands with me, and most kindly thanked me for
  having renewed our old acquaintance. To the account of
  this conversation with Lord Palmerston, I will add, that I
  asked, in the same bright month of May, for an interview
  with Lord Derby. He requested I would rather explain
  myself in writing: which I did; and received in answer
  from him a most condescending and kind letter, in which,
  while he asserted his own steadfast adherence to the Church
  of England, he declared his opinion that no one could reasonably
  find fault with me for exerting myself as I did to
  advance what
  I believed to be the truth.
</p>
<p>
Besides these interviews just recorded in his own words,
he had several others with minor celebrities. He met some
Protestant bishops; among the rest, Dr. Blomfield, whom
he tried to move to praying for unity. Dr. Blomfield
promised. Some of the bishops refuse to see him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">{412}</a></span>
others are "out" when he calls. He had an interview with
Dr. Cumming, and the doctor's account of it did not eventually
serve to raise that gentleman in the estimation of
honourable or sensible people. He records in his journal
being sent away ignominiously by Baptist and Methodist
ministers, and, after one of these rebuffs, on May 24, 1851,
he got so fearful a mobbing, when coming along the Charter
House in London, that he was nearly killed. Had not some
good shopkeeper opened his door for him, and helped him to
a cab by a back passage, he believed he would certainly have
fallen a victim to the fury of the crowd.
</p>
<p>
The day after this adventure, he assisted in Warwick-street
at the ordination of his Grace the present Archbishop
of Westminster, as sub-deacon.
</p>
<p>
He is a few months on the Continent again in this year.
He preaches in French through Lille, Lige, Maestricht,
Aix-la-Chapelle, always upon "the crusade." Before
arriving in Cologne he had his address translated into German,
in order to be able to speak to the Prussian children
and people upon his favourite theme. As he was walking
through Cologne one day, he accidentally met his brother,
Lord Spencer. Lord Spencer wondered at the figure
approaching him, and thought he recognized the features. At
length he exclaimed, "Hilloa, George, what are you doing
here?" "Begging," replied Father Ignatius. Those who
knew them were much gratified at seeing the earl and the
monk having a little friendly chat about old schoolboy days.
Both seemed a little embarrassed and surprised at first, but
after a minute or two they were quite at home with each
other.
</p>
<p>
He prepared a petition for the King of Prussia, who was
visiting Cologne, requesting an audience; but, after waiting
patiently a few days, he writes in the journal: "The King
is come and gone, but no notice of me. I must be content
with <i>Rex regum</i>." He received a letter from Father
Eugene a day or two before this, summoning him home to
England for our Provincial Chapter, and his tour terminates
on the 21st August.

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br>
Visit To Home And "The Association Of Prayers."</h2>
<br>
<p>
At the Provincial Chapter, Father Ignatius was chosen
Rector of St. Joseph's Retreat, The Hyde. It was also
arranged that before proceeding further with his projects
and schemes for prayers and unity, he should submit them
to the Roman <i>Curia</i>. He accordingly starts for Rome on
September 4, and arrives at the Retreat of SS. John and
Paul on the 13th. We shall let himself relate the events
and success of this expedition.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I went on then, taking occasions as they were offered me
  to move Catholics to interest themselves in it till September,
  1851, when I went to Rome. I had other reasons for
  going; but it might well be expected that what mainly
  interested me was to recommend the cause of England's conversion
  in the centre of Catholicity, and to obtain from the
  Holy See sanction and authority for pursuing this end as I
  had been doing before, or in whatever way would be deemed
  preferable. I was four months and a half at Rome, with
  the interruption of a fortnight, during which I was engaged
  on a mission in the country with some of our Fathers. My
  affair had to be transacted, as may be supposed, chiefly at
  the Propaganda, where the affairs of all Catholic missions
  are managed and directed, much in the way that our Board
  of Admiralty directs all the naval operations of this country,
  but under entire dependence on his Holiness and obedience
  to him&mdash;the secretary of the Propaganda, Monsignor
  Barnab, having regularly once a week, that is, every Sunday
  evening, an audience of the Pope, to make him reports,
  and to receive his orders. For the first six weeks or two
  months I felt my footing at the Propaganda more or less
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">{414}</a></span>
  doubtful and precarious. I did not gain much attention.
  This was mortifying; but I see, and I saw it then, to be
  right. The Propaganda is a place where all Catholic
  schemers and projectors in matters of religion try to get a
  hearing&mdash;as our Admiralty is besieged, I suppose, by all who
  think they have an important proposal to make for naval
  enterprise or improvement. They must be kept at arm's
  length for a time, till it is judged whether their ideas are worth
  attending to. It was on the 1st of November that it happened
  that I dined at the College of Propaganda, and sat
  next to Monsignor Barnab, who made me a remark about
  in these words: 'Surely if you can convert England, we
  should gain half the world&mdash;or all the world,' I forget
  which. I answered, 'Well, Monsignor, and why not try?'
  Nothing more was said then; but it seemed to me as if this
  was the turning-point of my fortunes at Rome. Certain it
  is, that from that time Monsignor Barnab, in the midst of
  all his pressing affairs, was invariably ready to listen to me
  at the office or at his own house, read through all my long
  memorials, spoke for me to the Pope whenever I asked him,
  and gained me what I asked on this matter, had my papers
  printed free of cost at the press of the Propaganda, &amp;c. It
  had been told me previously by one of the minutanti (under
  secretaries) of the Propaganda, Monsignor Vespasiani, that
  my proposals would be looked upon more favourably, if England
  were not mentioned as the only object of interest. He
  adverted especially with great feeling to the case of the
  Greeks, of whom he spoke as possessing genius and capacity
  for such great things, if they were only reunited to the
  Church. At his suggestion I drew up, in concert with one
  of our Fathers, a paper of proposals for an Association for
  the Conversion of all separated from the Church, giving
  reasons, however, as I do in the little paper of admission to
  our Association, why we should direct our immediate aim
  at the recovery of those nations which have been separated
  from the Church by heresy or schism, and why, among these,
  England should still be regarded as the most important and
  leading object. This document was read by Mgr. Barnab,
  who ordered 5,000 copies to be printed by the press of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">{415}</a></span>
  Propaganda&mdash;rather, he told me, to order as many as I
  wished, as well as of another shorter paper containing an
  invitation to prayer and good works for the conversion of
  all separated from the Church, but especially of England.
  This shorter one was prepared at the express desire of the
  Cardinal-Vicar of Rome, and distributed by his order through
  all the religious houses of the city. To pass over other details,
  it was on the 26th of November that I received a letter of
  recommendation, addressed by the Cardinal-Prefect of Propaganda
  to all Bishops, Vicars-Apostolic, and Superiors of
  Missions in the world, desiring them to receive me favourably
  and to assist me in my designs to the utmost of their
  power. The words in Latin at this part of the letter are the
  following:&mdash;'... Proindeque illum sacrae congregationis
  testimonialibus hisce literis instructum esse volumus, ut
  omnes Episcopi, Vicarii Apostolici, et Missionum Superiores
  benigne illum excipere, ac pro viribus piissimis ejusdem votis
  favere haud omittant.' As I have not this letter at hand
  while writing, I quote this part from memory. The former
  part, of which I have not the words by heart, expresses why
  this recommendation was to be given me; namely, because
  my zeal for promoting the Catholic faith, especially among
  my people of England, was highly to be commended. Now,
  if the Propaganda should have ever heard anything true about
  how I carried on my ordinary duties in England, they could
  only have heard that I had not incurred suspension, though
  I might have deserved it; and that, in comparison with my
  brother priests in our great towns, for instance, what I had
  done for religion must be put down as next to nothing.
  The only thing on which they could ever have heard me
  spoken about as remarkable must have been my exertions,
  which, against my wishes, I must certainly concede to have
  been <i>singularly</i> active and persevering in calling people's
  attention to the object of the <i>conversion of England</i> and to
  prayers for it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I was surprised at receiving this letter; but I was not
  satisfied with it: it sharpened my appetite to get more. I
  returned to the Palace of the Propaganda to give thanks
  for it, and then asked for a special letter to the Prelates of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
  Ireland. I do not here enter into details about this: I
  intend, if permitted, explaining all which regards this subject
  in some letters addressed especially to the Irish people,
  in the <i>Tablet</i>. I mention it here only to quote from this
  second letter the words in which is explained more particularly
  the idea which was formed at the Propaganda of the
  object which they were recommending. They call it 'Opus
  quod Reverendus Pater Ignatius promovere satagit, ut nempe
  Catholici pro Acatholicorum, praesertim Angliae, conversione
  veluti agmine facto, ferventiori jugiter ratione preces
  fundant ....' which I thus translate: 'The object
  which the Rev. Father Ignatius is engaged in promoting,
  namely, that Catholics should, as it were, form themselves
  into an army set in array, and with continually increasing
  fervour pour forth prayers for the conversion of non-Catholics,
  but especially of England." Now, I do not know how
  these documents may strike others; but it seems to me that
  if, after having taken a journey to Rome on purpose to plead
  my cause there, and after having received letters like these
  in answer to my appeals, I was just now to relax in my zeal
  to promote prayers and good works for the conversion of
  Protestants, but especially of England, this would be not
  falling into the views of the Holy See, as some seem to
  think it would, but rather showing indifference and almost
  contempt for them, and repaying with ingratitude the great
  favours which I have received. I must reserve to another
  letter some account of my interviews with his Holiness in
  person.
<br><br>
    "I am, Sir, your faithful servant in Jesus Christ,<br>
      "Ignatius Of St. Paul, Passionist."
</p>
<p>
Here is the account of the audiences he had with the
Pope on the subject of prayers for the conversion of England.
It is taken from his letters to the <i>Catholic
Standard</i>:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  <span class="quotehead">Audiences With Pope Pius IX.</span>
<br><br>
  I beg to give an account of what passed upon the subject
  of the conversion of England in the audiences I was allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
  by the Holy Father. They were three. The first was on
  September 16, 1851, three days after my arrival in Rome;
  the second, December 23; the third, January 30, 1852, the
  day before I left Rome. It was on my return home in the
  evening after that last audience that I met Mgr. Vespasiani,
  the prelate whom I have before named as one of the Minutanti
  of the Propaganda, the first person in office at Rome
  who gave full and attentive consideration to my proposals.
  This was on the 14th of October, 1851. Full of satisfaction
  as I was, I expressed to him anew my gratitude for that
  favour, adding that now I was leaving Rome, I felt as if I
  had nothing more to ask. All was gained. Such, indeed,
  were my feelings then. He kindly accepted my acknowledgments,
  and seemed to sympathize in my satisfaction, but
  looked incredulous as to my having nothing more to ask, and
  with a smile, said something to this effect, "You will want
  plenty more; and, when you desire, you will command our
  services." I suppose he was right. My feeling was then,
  and I conceive it was well grounded, that, as far as regarded
  the mind of his Holiness, I had gained all, on the subject
  which most engaged me, and which I am now pursuing;
  and I felt as if in having reached this point all was done.
  So, I trust, it will prove in time; but I see plainly enough
  there is work to be done before the mind of the Holy Father
  will be carried out; others must be moved to correspond with
  it. I must explain myself by stating facts. In my first
  two audiences, I think I may say that the principle was
  approved by his Holiness, that Catholics might be moved
  all through the world to engage in the enterprise of converting
  England; but that he must not be represented as caring
  for England exclusively, as he was father to all. There was
  no objection here expressed to my being specially interested
  for my own country. On the contrary, the Pope agreed to,
  and approved of, my continuing to urge the Roman people
  to join in this cause, as well as pursuing the same object in
  Austria, whither I told him I was going, and elsewhere. In
  my second audience I said to him: "Holy Father, may I
  repeat truly here what I am saying outside? I am openly
  stirring the people of Rome to a third conquest of England.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
  Rome conquered England once, under Julius Caesar, by the
  material sword. Rome conquered England a second time,
  more gloriously, under St. Gregory I., by the Word of God.
  I am calling on Rome to undertake this conquest again,
  under Pius IX., when it will be a vastly more important
  one than heretofore, and by means more glorious and more
  divine, because referring more purely the glory to God, being
  chiefly holy prayer." The Pope did not speak in answer to
  this appeal; but, if I rightly judged, his manner and looks
  expressed his acceptance and approval of the idea better
  than words could have done. However, though I might
  say I had succeeded as well as I could have expected in
  these first two audiences, the second of which I looked upon
  as final, as in it I had taken my leave of his Holiness,
  there was yet something wanting. I was preparing to
  leave Rome not quite satisfied, though I knew not how to
  better my position. I will relate how the happy conclusion
  was brought round. My departure was unexpectedly
  delayed in order that I might assist at a mission to be
  given by our fathers, in the town of Marino, on the Alban
  mountains, which was in the diocese of the Cardinal-Vicar,
  at whose request the mission was given. I went
  to the mission, not so much to work, as to see, and hear,
  and learn for myself; but the crowd of penitents was
  such, that during the last week of it I gave myself entirely
  to the confessions; and having no part in the preaching,
  I never did such a week's work at confessions as
  that. I returned to Rome alone on January 18, to prepare
  for my departure, leaving the other Fathers to begin
  a second mission at Albano; and it struck me my week's
  work for the Cardinal-Vicar need not be altogether its own
  reward. I visited him the next day, as to make a report of
  the mission, which was highly satisfactory. I then said, "I
  have done a heavy week's work for your Eminence, and I
  come to claim <i>il mio stipendio</i> (my pay)." "And what," said
  he, "is that?" "A few minutes' patience," I replied, "to
  hear me again on the cause of England. I want Rome to
  be effectually moved." "But," said he again, "what can
  we do? I have distributed your papers. I will recommend
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
  it again; what more do you want? Perhaps the Pope could
  suggest something; go to him again." I answered, "I have
  had my final audience, and received his last blessing. Can
  I go again?" "Oh, yes. Go; you may use my name." I
  went straight to the Vatican, and Monsignor Talbot placed
  me, according to custom, in a saloon, through which the
  Pope was to pass at three o'clock, to take his daily drive. I
  told his Holiness what had brought me again before him. I
  had received recommendations to all the world, but I was
  particularly intent on moving Rome. "Surely," he said,
  "that is the most important place. Write me a memorial,
  and we will consult over it." I lost no time in doing so.
  In it I dwelt on two objects; first, I entreated the Holy
  Father to take such measures as he might in his wisdom
  think fit, to move all Christendom to undertake the recovery
  of the nations which had been lost to the Church, and
  specially England. And with regard to Rome, I stated the
  case thus. I had received from the congregations through
  which his Holiness intimates his pleasure to the whole
  Church, an earnest recommendation to all Bishops to support
  me to the utmost of their power in my enterprise. Was it
  to be conceived, I asked, that the Bishop of the first See was
  alone excluded from this recommendation? Surely not;
  and therefore in the name of his Holiness, as head of the
  Universal Church, I appealed to his Holiness as Bishop of
  Rome, and entreated that he would give an example to all
  other Bishops, how a mandate of the Holy See ought to be
  obeyed. It was not for me to offer directions how this
  should be done; but if I were to make a suggestion, I would
  ask that a Prelate should be named, with an authority to
  engage the help of other zealous ecclesiastics, and with them
  to instruct the people of Rome in the importance and beauty
  of the work, and to engage them in it with persevering zeal.
  I took this memorial to the Cardinal-Vicar, who read
  through the latter part with me, and said, with an air of
  satisfaction, "<i>That will do; that will do very well</i>"&mdash;promising
  to present it to the Pope. I begged him to say
  besides, that the Prelate I had in my mind was Monsignor
  Talbot. This was on January 23. On the 26th, Monsignor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">{420}</a></span>
  Barnab told me that all had been favourably received. I
  thought I had nothing to do but to arrange with Monsignor
  Talbot what he might do, and for this purpose I went on
  the 30th of January to see him, accompanied by one of our
  Fathers. I had bid him farewell, when my companion said,
  "May we see the Pope?" I was rather annoyed at this:
  the sight of the Pope intended was merely to be once more
  placed in his way as he would pass one of the saloons: and
  I felt it would be unreasonable and intrusive for me to
  be seen there again; but I thought it would be selfish to
  disappoint my companion, who had sacrificed so much of his
  time to gratify me, and I said nothing. We were, therefore,
  taken into the saloon, as it was just the time for the Pope's
  drive. There, however, we waited one quarter, two quarters,
  three quarters of an hour. I concluded, what was the case,
  that the Pope was not going out, and expected presently to
  be told to go away. Instead of this Monsignor Talbot came
  and beckoned us into the Pope's private room, where he was
  sitting in the window recess perfectly at his ease, and
  received us with these words addressed to me:&mdash;"Well,
  Father Ignatius, we have done something now." "Indeed,
  Holy Father," said I, "this is true. I see this work now
  in the way to become the most favoured of all, entrusted,
  as it is, to a Prelate who has his time so disposed that one
  week he is free to work, and the other he returns to attendance
  on your Holiness to make his reports, and receive
  new instructions." "Not only so," replied the Pope, "there
  are four of them. He has but one week entirely engaged
  with me; besides the one out of four wholly free, he has
  but two or three hours every day on duty in the other two.
  But remember, I will not have England alone thought of."
  "Holy Father," I said, "this alteration has been made.
  The undertaking is for all separated nations; England being
  proposed only as the most important point of attack, on
  several accounts. I beg, however, to ask that the term
  heretics may not be used as the general designation of those
  we pray for. I do not confess to wilful heresy before my
  conversion. I do not confess for this sin for my countrymen
  at large." "Ah! what say you?" answered the Pope; then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">{421}</a></span>
  he reflected for a moment and graciously bowed. In accordance
  with this request, in my letter from the Propaganda
  the term is not <i>haereticorum</i>, but <i>acatholicorum praesertim
  Angliae</i>. I went on: "Holy Father, I ask one more favour.
  Cardinal Fornari has agreed, if he is named by your Holiness,
  to accept the charge of Protector to this work." "What
  need of this?" answered the Pope; "I have desired the
  Cardinal-Vicar to recommend the work to Rome, and Cardinal
  Fornari is a Roman. Is that not enough?" "Holy
  Father," I replied, "what is requested is, that he should be
  empowered to act in it as Cardinal." After another pause
  his Holiness again graciously bowed and said: "Well, be
  it so." Thus the discourse on this subject terminated: and,
  if I have intelligibly explained myself, will it not be allowed
  that I had reason to go home satisfied, in the reflection that
  the work of the conversion of Protestants, but chiefly England,
  was now erected&mdash;as far as regarded the part which
  the holy Father had to take in it&mdash;into what may be almost
  called a congregation in the Holy City, to be composed of
  prelates and ecclesiastics, of whom the first active member
  was among his Holiness's domestic attendants; and the
  Cardinal Protector was one of the most distinguished of the
  Sacred College, who in his first conversation with me declared
  his most lively interest in England, as having himself,
  as Professor in the Roman Seminary, directed the studies in
  Theology of Cardinal Wiseman, and four others, now
  Bishops in England, besides two deceased. I must close
  this long letter with one more fact, which came to my
  knowledge, bringing home to me the consoling conviction,
  how deeply the heart of our Holy Father is interested in
  the great work. When I was in Paris, this cause of England
  was ardently taken up by a gentleman noted for his
  Catholic zeal, a distinguished merchant in Havre. On my
  leaving Paris he begged me to give him a letter of credentials,
  that, in his mercantile travels, he might in my name
  interest Bishops and other leading personages in our favour.
  In November last he enclosed me a letter he had received
  from the Vicar-General of Nantes, to whom he had applied
  to recommend this object to his Bishop. It was in these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">{422}</a></span>
  terms: "I will gladly perform your commission, and I have
  no doubt his Lordship will comply with your wish; the
  more so that, returning from Rome a few days back, I have
  brought to him a message to the same effect from his Holiness.
  In my first audience the Pope said to me: 'Tell the
  Bishop of Nantes, from me, that I desire he will pray, and
  cause others to pray, a great deal for England. The position
  of the Church in that kingdom interests me deeply; I am
  always thinking of it.' In my second audience the Holy
  Father repeated to me the same words, and in a tone of
  feeling such as I can never forget. I am convinced this
  subject occupies his mind continually." Is it, now, to be
  supposed that the Holy Father is averse to English and
  Irish Catholics praying especially for England, and praying
  much for it? Is it not, on the contrary, to be inferred from
  these statements, and those of my last two letters, that it
  would console his heart to see them devotedly engaged in
  the work? I think this is the conclusion to which we shall
  all arrive, and that this happy result may in due time&mdash;and
  why not soon?&mdash;be abundantly realized.
</p>
<p>
He says in another letter:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I begin with repeating
  again the words of St. Jerome to Pope Damasus: 'He who
  gathereth not with thee scattereth,' and I renew my declaration
  that if I thought that by exerting myself to move the
  Catholics of England and Ireland, and, in general, of all
  the world, to the enterprise of gaining England, my country,
  back to the faith of our fathers, I was not working in accordance
  with the mind of his Holiness, I should not dare to
  proceed. Will my dear Catholic brethren meet me with the
  assurance that if it appears by facts that this enterprise is
  according to his mind, they will heartily devote themselves
  to the cause and help us?
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It seems to me still, as it always did, impossible to conceive
  how these efforts, carried on as they are proposed to
  be, in perfect accordance with devoted loyalty to the State,
  and in a spirit of ardent charity towards our fellow-countrymen,
  should not be gratifying to the Church of God and to
  its Head. Many times have I repeated in sermons to the
  Irish people during the days of the troubles of his Holiness:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>
  'You have joined with noble generosity in assisting the Holy
  Father by subscriptions of money, you have entered fervently
  into prayer for him, will you not do one thing more to console
  him? Let him hear that you are determined that my
  country, with its great resources and power, shall once more
  be his.' This was, I think, a reasonable natural suggestion.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It was, accordingly, a surprise to me, and at the same
  time a pain, when I was told by one, about the beginning
  of the year 1851, that his Holiness was become almost
  averse to our efforts in behalf of England; as on being
  applied to for some new indulgence for certain prayers for
  England, he would not grant the petition unless Italy was
  comprehended in the intention of the prayers. Another
  said positively that the Pope would give no more indulgences
  for prayers for England. These things were said, as
  so many more things have been said, apparently in a half-joking
  tone, to mortify me in what is known to be a tender
  point. "Well, everything may turn to account for good, if
  we pay attention. These remarks helped to stimulate me
  to ascertain perfectly what the truth of the case is, and they
  now give me occasion to explain publicly some of the facts
  on which the matter has to be judged.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "In May, 1850, a student of the English College at Rome,
  just ordained, went to receive the Pope's blessing before his
  return to England. He presented a crucifix to his Holiness,
  and begged for an indulgence of 300 days for whoever kissed
  this crucifix, and said a Hail Mary for the conversion of
  England. The Pope sat down and wrote with his own hand
  at the foot of the petition, that he granted 300 days' indulgence
  for those who should offer a devout prayer, as for
  instance a Hail Mary, for the conversion of England. When
  this was reported to me, as there appeared some kind of
  ambiguity in one expression of the Pope's writing, I wrote
  to Monsignor Talbot, begging that he would ascertain from
  his Holiness whether we were right in interpreting the
  sentence as granting the indulgence generally without any
  reference to the crucifix. The answer was, 'Yes.' Evidently
  then, at this time, the Pope was disposed to grant
  more in favour of England than he was asked. How are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
  we to account for the seeming alteration in his dispositions?
  One way is to suppose that the Pope had ceased to wish
  prayers to be made for England. Monsignor Talbot, when
  I saw him at Rome in September, 1851, gave me another
  reason. 'The Pope,' said he, 'is determined he will give
  no more indulgences for England. People seem not to care
  for them. No account is made of them. Let them first
  show they value what they have.' No authority, on such a
  point, could be preferable to that of Monsignor Talbot, who
  spends his life in personal attendance on his Holiness; and
  according to him, the Pope did, in a tone of some displeasure,
  refuse one or two such requests, the displeasure was not
  because people prayed too much for England, but because
  they did not pray enough, and on this account, did not deserve
  any more encouragement. This view I maintain with
  the more confidence, inasmuch as after that displeasure had
  been expressed, a petition was made on March 9, 1851, by
  some English ladies in Rome for a plenary indulgence to
  be gained once a month by those who should daily pray for
  the conversion of England: it was granted as stated in our
  admission papers. I infer from this, that if only the Holy
  Father perceived that the Catholics of England were really
  in earnest in the cause, there would be no bounds to the
  liberality with which he would encourage them; but no one
  likes to go on giving favours to persons who seem not to
  value them; and he who has the dispensing of the favours
  of Almighty God from the treasuries of the Church, must
  not consent to their being undervalued.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But now, it will be asked, what encouragement did I
  myself receive from his Holiness during the four months
  and a half that I spent in Rome, as a kind of representative
  of this cause of the conversion of England? I need not
  say that, in going to Rome, I was desirous to move all hearts
  there to an enthusiastic devotion to this enterprise, as I had
  endeavoured to do in Ireland, in France, in Belgium, and
  Germany. I fain would not have lost an occasion of preaching
  in churches, addressing religious communities, the children
  of schools, wherever I could find them assembled. I did not
  expect, however, to be able at once to run such a career in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
  Rome, as in ordinary towns, and I was greatly satisfied with
  what was allowed me. Whatever difficulty or check I might
  have met with, it came not from his Holiness. The proper
  authority to apply to in this case was the Cardinal-Vicar;
  that is, he who administers the very diocese of Rome as the
  Pope's Vicar-General. He at once agreed to my visiting
  convents and schools, and exhorting them to the great work;
  but for preaching in churches, there must be, he said, express
  sanction from the Pope. The Holy Father was consequently
  consulted by Monsignor Talbot, and answered that he had
  no objection, but left it to me to make arrangements with
  the rectors of the churches. The number of monasteries
  and schools in which I made my allocutions on the conversion
  of England, is past my remembrance. Almost day by
  day, for about two months of my time, this was my leading
  pursuit. I wish it to be clearly understood that all this time I
  spoke all that was in my mind with as complete freedom from
  reserve as I am known to exercise here. To the authorities in
  Rome, who are not wanting in vigilance, all must have been
  known; and one word from them of objection to the subject,
  or to my manner of treating it, spoken to my superiors, would
  have at once stopped me. The number of churches in which
  I spoke was not so great. I used generally to ask leave
  myself to address convents and schools. I saw that it would
  not be becoming to offer myself thus to speak in churches at
  Rome; but among others I may mention particularly, that
  I preached by invitation, in English, in French, and in
  Italian, in those of the large and frequented churches
  S. Andrea della Valle, S. Luigi de' Francesi, and S. Andrea
  della Fratte; and the Pope himself spoke to me of this last
  discourse in a tone of satisfaction. He would not have been
  opposed, as far as could be observed, if, instead of three
  churches, I could have made up a list of three hundred.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Another means I took for moving the Roman people
  was, by the papers printed for me by the Propaganda, of
  which I spoke in my last letter. The first of these was
  thus headed:&mdash;'Association of Prayers and Good Works for
  the Conversion of those who are separated from the Holy
  Catholic Church, but especially of England.' Before this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">{426}</a></span>
  writing was printed, I gave a copy of it to Monsignor
  Talbot, to lay before the Pope. He returned it to me, with
  this addition in his own hand:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'His Holiness has deigned to grant to this pious work
  his special benediction.<br>
    "'George Talbot, Cameriere Segreto.<br>
    "'<i>Nov</i>. 15, 1851.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "To this is appended the petition presented for me by
  Monsignor Barnab, for the extension of indulgences, as
  follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'Most Blessed Father,&mdash;Ignatius of St. Paul (Spencer),
  Passionist, Provincial Consultor in England, prostrate at
  the feet of your Holiness, states that, being desirous of
  extending the Association of Prayers already existing for
  England, in favour of all those who are separated from the
  Holy Church, and being sensible that a fresh spiritual
  attraction is necessary in order to move all the faithful to
  enter on this holy enterprise, most humbly implores your
  Holiness, that you would be pleased to extend the three
  hundred days' indulgence already granted by your Holiness
  to whoever prays for the conversion of England, to this new
  work, and moreover grant one hundred days for whatever
  good work may be done in favour of this Association.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Monsignor Barnab reported, that though the Pope adverted
  to his former declaration, that he would give no more
  indulgences on this account, he granted this petition in the
  most gracious manner. The date of this grant is Nov. 16,
  1851.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is evidently intimated here, that while granting his
  sanction to the extension of the enterprise, he renewed his
  sanction to it in its original form. I must here conclude,
  and defer again to another letter what I promised before,
  that is, some account of what passed in the audiences to
  which I myself was admitted by his Holiness."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  An incident happened towards the end of Father Ignatius's
  audiences with the Holy Father, highly characteristic.
  Father Ignatius had made arrangements for a begging tour
  in Germany, and intended to inaugurate it by trying what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
  he could do in that line in Rome itself. Our General forbade
  him to beg of his Holiness, and Father Ignatius had
  made up his mind before to do so. After the prohibition
  he began to doubt whether it was binding, as the Pope was
  a higher superior than the General. He consulted an astute
  Roman theologian on his doubt, and the answer given was,
  "Lay the doubt itself before the Pope."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  Father Ignatius had an audience in store for him for a
  different matter, and when it was over, he said, in the
  greatest simplicity, "Holy Father, I have a scruple on my
  mind, which I would wish to speak about, if I might be
  permitted." "Well, and what is it?" He here told the
  Pope just as he was advised. The Pope smiled, handed
  him ten <i>gregorine</i> (about 25), and told him not to mind
  the scruple.
</p>
<br>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br>
A Tour In Germany.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Father Ignatius left Rome with the Holy Fathers blessing
on both his spiritual and temporal projects. On his
way to Germany, whither he was bound for a twofold
begging tour, he preached everywhere to religious, priests,
nuns, people, and children, upon the conversion of England.
He went further than mere exhortation, he tried to get
the Bishops and religious to take up his ideas, now stamped
with the approbation of Rome, and propagate them among
those under their jurisdiction. He met with kindness and
encouragement in every town and hamlet until he came to
Laibach. Here the police seized him and sent him away.
At Gratz he met with a better reception. Throughout, the
priests and religious receive him with a something approaching
to honour, and so do the nobility, but government officials
and the like treat him rudely enough.
</p>
<p>
When he arrived in Vienna, he found a way of conciliating
these officers of justice and their subalterns. Graf
(Count) O'Donnel took him to the Secretary of Police, and
procured him a safe-conduct, whereby this kind of annoyance
was put an end to for the future. Great personages
patronize him&mdash;among the chief were Prince Esterhazy,
Counts O'Donnel and Litchenstein. Through their kindness
and his own repute, he is favoured with interviews from
the members of the royal family. A few of these in his
own words must be interesting:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "While at Rome, I heard one day the wonderful account
  of the <i>coup d'tat</i> of the now Emperor of the French. I
  thought with myself that moment, here is a man for me&mdash;
  perhaps <i>the</i> man. If he survive the assaults of his enemies,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">{429}</a></span>
  and become established in power over France, he is the
  man evidently for great designs; the people whom he rules
  are the people to follow him in them; and he has a mind,
  so I conceived, to understand how utterly insignificant are
  all enterprises, in comparison with those which have the
  glory of God and the salvation of souls for their end. But
  will he, can he, be moved to take up the great cause? I
  got an introduction to the French ambassador at Rome, in
  order to open my way to an interview with his chief. This
  may be in reserve for me some future day; but I was first
  to see another great man&mdash;the young Emperor of Austria.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I think an account of this audience, and some accompanying
  circumstances, will be interesting in more points of view
  than one. After leaving Rome at the beginning of February,
  I went to Vienna, and stopped there three weeks before
  coming home. The Emperor had just left Vienna for Venice
  when I arrived, and did not return till a fortnight after. In
  consequence of this, I sought for, and had audience of all
  the other members of the royal family then in the town.
  Many may not be aware of the circumstances under which
  the present Emperor was raised to the throne. Everything
  connected with this young man is to me full of a kind of
  poetic interest. He is the eldest son of the Archduke
  Francis Charles and the Archduchess Sophia, a princess of
  Bavaria. His father is brother to the ex-Emperor Ferdinand.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is said that in 1848, at the time when the insurgents
  had gained possession of Vienna, and the court was in
  flight, some one asked the Empress Mary Ann, a Sardinian
  princess, 'Madam, have you ever thought of an abdication?'
  'I have, indeed,' answered she; 'but what is to
  follow?' The Emperor had no children, and his next heir
  was his brother the Archduke. Both of them have been
  always highly respected as most amiable and religious men,
  but are not of abilities or character to bear the charge of an
  empire under such circumstances. The abdication, then, of
  the reigning Emperor would not have been a remedy to
  existing evils, unless his brother joined in the sacrifice of his
  claims, and made way for the succession of his son. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">{430}</a></span>
  arrangement, however, was effected; and, if what I gathered
  from conversations and observation is correct, it is to the two
  ladies whom I have mentioned, that the empire is indebted
  for it. Do not they deserve the admiration of the present
  and future generations, and to have their place among the
  <i>valiant women</i>, for renouncing the honours of an imperial
  crown, for the public good? Be this as it may, the announcement
  was made to the young prince, then eighteen years of
  age, that the crown was his. It is said that he burst into
  tears at hearing it, and begged two days for reflection, during
  which he went to confession and communion, to obtain light
  from God, and concluded with giving his consent. His
  career has been conformable with this beginning. Among
  other things, I may mention that one of his first acts was, of
  his own mind, to repeal the oppressive laws of Joseph II.,
  and to restore liberty to the Church. Could I do otherwise
  than long to interest such a soul as this in the great cause I
  was supporting? Shall I succeed in the end? I had an
  audience of the Archduchess Sophia, the Emperor's mother,
  before his return from Venice. It is under her care and
  guidance, as I was assured, that his character has been
  formed; and it was touching to hear her make me a kind of
  apology for what might, perhaps, be taken as a defect in his
  manner. I told her I was desirous of an audience of his
  Majesty. She said, 'You will certainly obtain it;' and
  she added, "You will perhaps think him cold, but he is not
  so.' This corresponds with what she said to a friend of
  mine, a German literary character, who was likewise about
  to have his first audience from the Emperor. The Archduchess
  said to him, 'His manner is not winning, like that
  of Carl [meaning her third son, the Archduke Charles], but
  he has greater depth of character; from his childhood upwards
  I never knew him say a word merely to please; every
  word is from his heart.' These few words of his mother are
  to me a most precious comment on what passed between the
  Emperor and me when I had my audience. I was introduced
  into a large saloon on one of the days of public reception.
  The Emperor stood alone in the middle of it; behind him,
  to the left, was a small table, on which was a pile of
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">{431}</a></span>
  memorials which he had already received. He was in military
  uniform. I should be glad to convey the impression which
  his appearance, and the few words he spoke, made on me.
  A young emperor, I suppose, has great advantage in gaining
  upon one's feelings, if he will in any degree do himself
  justice. In this case, I say, that I never was more satisfied,
  not to say captivated, with my observations on any person.
  His figure is not in itself commanding; but there was in his
  air and manner and tone a union of grace and affability,
  dignity, wisdom, and modesty, which I do not remember to
  have seen equalled. I was greatly struck, on my entrance,
  with what appeared to me such a contrast between what I
  witnessed and the receptions usually given by great personages
  who wish to be gracious. Ordinarily, my impression
  is that they overwhelm one with many words, which often
  mean nothing. The Emperor was perfectly silent. I had
  time to think with myself, after I had approached him, 'Am
  I then to speak first? So it was. I have a very clear
  recollection of what was said.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'I have requested this audience,' I said, 'to represent
  to your Majesty the object for which I am travelling. It
  is to move Catholics throughout the world to interest themselves
  in obtaining the return of my country to the Catholic
  faith. On this, I am deeply convinced, depends entirely
  the happiness of my country; and, I conceive, nothing would
  more contribute to the happiness of other nations of the
  world.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The Emperor seemed to intimate assent to this, and
  said with great grace: 'I am happy to hear that things go
  on better in England in regard to religion than they have
  done.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'There is much,' I said, 'to encourage hopes; but we
  want great help. I am come to ask the help of Austria. I
  do not take on me to prescribe what your Majesty in person
  might do in this cause. As the principal means to be employed
  is prayer, I am aware that it belongs rather to Bishops

  "He answered: 'I will interest myself as much at possible.'

  further. It is to the Bishops that I make my principal
  appeal to interest the people in this object. Now, I am
  aware that they would and must be averse to any public
  measures which might seem to involve political inconvenience:
  I would, therefore, ask of your Majesty, that if the

<p class="cite">
  "In my last letter I repeated the words in which that
  wise and excellent Princess, the Archduchess Sophia,
  described the character of two of her sons: 'The Emperor
  seems cold, but he is not so. He is not winning and amiable
  like Carl, but he has more solidity and depth.' I remarked
  that to me these words were a most interesting commentary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
  on what passed in the short audience I had from the young
  Emperor; and if I succeeded in my description of it, I am
  sure others will think with me. I will now give some
  account of my audience with the third brother, the young
  Archduke Charles. The second brother, whose name I do
  not now remember, was not in Vienna at the time. He is a
  seaman, and I suppose it is intended that under his auspices
  the Austrian navy should be advanced to greater vigour and
  efficiency, while the Emperor and Charles attend mainly to
  the army. The empire possesses two splendid ports&mdash;Trieste
  and Venice; and past history proves what may be done with
  the latter alone.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I made acquaintance with a Swiss ecclesiastic in Vienna
  (Mgr. Mislin), who bore a part in the education of all three
  of these princes. I had told him what were my desires
  concerning them; that is, to inspire them with ardent zeal
  for the great work of the reunion of Christendom, but especially
  the reconquest of England for the Church. One day
  the Abb called to see me, at the palace of the Pope's
  Nuncio, where I was staying; and as I was out, he left
  word that he wished to see me without delay. He had to
  tell me, as I found, that the Archduke Charles, with whom
  he regularly goes to dine every Friday, had said to him on
  the last of these occasions, 'Do you know Father Ignatius?'
  'Yes,' he answered, 'very well.' 'Do you think,' added the
  Prince, 'I could see him? I wish it very much.' 'Oh,'
  replied the Abb, 'there will be no difficulty; 'and at once
  an hour was fixed&mdash;two o'clock on the 11th of March. It
  happened, however, that notice was received that at this
  very time the Emperor was to arrive from Trieste, and the
  Archduke had to go to the railway terminus to meet him.
  My audience was deferred till half-past three; and I went
  with the Abb to the private entrance of the imperial
  palace to see them arrive. They were driven up from the
  station in a light open carriage; and it was thus, side by
  side, that I first saw them both. I may be mistaken, but in
  my poetic recollections and visions of Vienna, if I, who am
  no poet, may so speak, these two brothers are charmingly
  conjoined in my mind. At half-past three, then, I went to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">{434}</a></span>
  the Archduke's apartments in the Burg, as it is called&mdash;a
  great mass of building, which includes the Emperor's town
  residence, apartments for all the royal family, several public
  offices, extensive quarters for troops, &amp;c.&mdash;and was immediately
  introduced to him in a large drawing-room, where he
  kept me a good half-hour in lively conversation. My impression
  of him was, of a bright, buoyant youth, full of
  shining prospects of his future career; in which, though,
  perhaps, somewhat unconsciously to himself, he is both qualified
  by circumstances and character, and nobly disposed to
  exert himself for everything great and good. All this, however,
  is yet to be developed and consolidated by age, reflection,
  and experience. I should say, not so much that he
  himself is eagerly grasping at facts with which to store his
  mind, to be in due time digested, matured, and acted upon,
  as that Providence is turning to account his natural youthful
  eagerness, and shall we say, curiosity, to do this for him.
  May it prove that I am not forming over bright and groundless
  visions!
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The Archduke was dressed in a plain cavalry uniform.
  He was then about 19 years old, and very young-looking for
  his age. My object was to impress him with the grand importance
  of the enterprise which I was proposing as proper
  to form the dearest and constant aim of his brother's reign;
  that is, the restoring union to Christendom, having peculiarly
  in view the reconciling England to the Church. 'I have no
  wish,' I said, 'to see him, the Emperor, less devoted to his
  army: let him watch with constant care over all the interests
  of his Imperial dignity; but let him be devoted, above all
  and in everything, to the glory of God, and the repairing
  the losses of the Holy Church; and if it pleases God he
  should live, he will have a career more glorious, and leave a
  name greater than Charlemagne.' He said, 'Surely what
  you propose is most important. It is a matter to be deeply
  deplored that so many German states are cut off from the
  Church.' .....  I do not remember clearly much
  more of what passed in this conversation, and in truth it is
  not of so much consequence; for his words are not all
  weighed, solid, and worth recording, like those of his more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
  sage brother. All have not the same gifts, natural or spiritual;
  and it is not well they should. Of course, it is not
  well, because God has ordered it thus. But I could see in
  the diversity of these young men what might be wonderfully
  combined for doing great things. Charles would not be the
  one to govern and control, and he has not this to do. The
  Emperor has; and he is cut out for it. But then perhaps
  he is not one to win and conciliate those who do not know
  how to value all superior qualities like his; yet this is
  necessary in such times, especially when sound, old-fashioned
  loyalty is not much known. But let the two brothers work
  together; let their hearts be one, and let that one purpose
  be directed to noble ends, and it will be well for them, for
  the empire, and for Europe. Charles will supply what the
  other wants. I asked Monsignor Mislin one day, with an
  anxious feeling, whether they were really affectionate, loving
  brothers, and the answer was satisfactory."

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br>
Father Ignatius Returns To England.</h2>
<br>
<p>
He lands at Dover on the 1st April, 1852, comes home,
sets his house in order at the Hyde, and goes, after Holy
Week, to see Father Eugene, the Provincial, at St. Wilfrid's,
to give an account of himself. His name was about this
time in every one's mouth, his doings were canvassed by
friends and foes, and many and various were the opinions
held about him. In the meantime he went on with his
ordinary duties. He gives the retreat in Sedgeley Park again,
and one to the congregation at Havant. It was whilst
here, in the house of Mr. Scholfield, that he read Lord
Derby's proclamation against appearing abroad in the religious
habit.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius had to return to London next day, and
did not wish to violate this prohibition. He was sadly at
a loss; he had brought no secular clothes with him, and the
gentleman with whom he was staying was short and stout,
so that it was hopeless to think of getting anything suitable
from his wardrobe. The butler was taxed for a contribution;
all who had an article to spare gave heartily, and the Monk
was, after some ingenuity, equipped in the following fashion:
A pair of very light shoes, fitting badly and pinching sorely,
a pair of short coloured pantaloons, a great pilot overcoat, a
Scotch cap, cut so as to make it fit his head, formed the
<i>cap--pie</i> of Father Ignatius. He took refuge in Spanish
Place until the darkness of night might save him from
his juvenile friends along the Edgware
Road, who, if they
recognised him in his new fashion, would treat him to a
more than ordinary share of ridicule. He took off the shoes
when outside London, and one may imagine the surprise of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
the religious when he entered the choir thus arrayed, in the
middle of matins, to get Father Provincial's permission to
<i>change!</i>
</p>
<p>
Our Fathers shortly after were convoked by the Provincial
to a kind of chapter. Among other matters submitted
to their consideration, came the doings of Father
Ignatius. There were cavils on all sides, from within and
without, and many thought that it was his imprudence that
drew forth the proclamation. The nature of the charges
against him will be seen from an apologetic letter of his
to the <i>Standard</i>:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  To The Editor Of The "Catholic Standard."<br>
  Jesu Christi Passio.
<br><br>
  Sir,&mdash;I remarked in my last, not as a complaint, but quite
  the contrary, that I have often heard that good Catholics
  have suspected me to be not right in my head, because of
  my strange devotion to the conversion of England and of
  the many strange things which this fancy, as it seems to
  them, has led me to do. So far, indeed, am I from being
  surprised at or vexed by them, that I fairly declare that
  something like a suspicion of this kind sometimes flashes
  across my own mind. Suppose, for instance, I might hear
  of any one becoming deranged or being in danger of it, I
  have felt at times something like a sympathetic chord struck
  in my own mind, which seems to say, "Are people right,
  perhaps, after all? Am I not really mad on this point?'
  And it may take me a moment's thought to keep my fair
  even balance. How do I keep it?&mdash;Not as I might have
  done, some thirty years ago, by recollecting, what when
  young I used to hear said by my relations, with self-congratulation,
  "Well, thank God, there is no taint of madness
  in our family!&mdash;"No; I get my satisfaction independently
  of this, from a twofold consciousness, to one branch of which
  I could not have referred then&mdash;that is, from the consciousness,
  first, of a yet unimpaired memory concerning what I
  have seen and said and heard within reasonable limits of
  time; and secondly, from the consciousness, glory be to God for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
  it, of (may I say it without rashness?) a perfect Catholic,
  Apostolic, Roman faith. I <i>remember</i>&mdash;I cannot be mistaken
  in this&mdash;that, not two years ago, I spent four months in
  Rome, and spoke out there all my thoughts on this subject,
  as far as I had opportunity given, without a shadow of reserve,
  to the first authorities of the Church; and that it
  ended by my receiving and having in my possession documents
  fully approving of what I had been doing and purposed
  to do, from the first authorities of the Church, to
  which I may add the mention of testimonials signed by the
  Generals of the Dominicans, of the Conventual Franciscans,
  of the Franciscans <i>Strictioris Observantiae</i>, and of the
  Capuchins, recommending me to all local superiors of their
  respective orders, to the end that they should receive me to
  hospitality in all their houses, allow the use of their churches
  to preach in, and assist me in every possible way in my
  purposes. I have then said to myself, "It would indeed
  be no ordinary sort of madness breaking out for the first
  time in a family, which should have the marvellous power
  of communicating itself, infecting and dragging after it
  such a number of certainly very respectable heads; to which
  I may add, that the foundation, as it were, of all these
  testimonials, was a letter from his Eminence the Archbishop of
  Westminster, given me when I went into Germany in the
  summer of 1851, renewed with a fresh signature in 1852,
  after all my vagaries (?) at Vienna had taken place. In this
  letter, written in French by the hand of his Eminence
  himself&mdash;of whom I never heard any one express the idea
  that he was touched in the brain&mdash;he states that "having
  perfectly known me from the time of my conversion [I feel
  an intimate conviction in myself no one knows me better]
  he does not hesitate to recommend me to all the Catholics of
  the Continent, particularly to all bishops and ecclesiastics,
  secular and regular, as worthy of all their consideration
  and of their support, in the matters about which I should
  be engaged." No; I say, that on divine principles, almost
  as well as human, it is too much to imagine that I have
  been mad, thus far; whatever may be the case hereafter.
  Protestants, at least some of them, might say so, and might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
  think it too. No wonder. But will this remonstrance
  suffice to put an end to such insinuations from good Catholics?
  Mind, I am not displeased at them; nay, I relish
  these insinuations beyond what I can express. I have solid
  reasons for this; but I desire for the future to forego this
  personal consolation, for the sake of the souls of my poor
  countrymen, and of hundreds of millions more throughout
  the world, which I have the conviction might be saved, if
  the Catholics of England and Ireland would at length have
  done with their objections, and undertake with all their
  heart the gaining of this kingdom to God and His Church&mdash;
  and a reputed madman is not likely to move them to
  it. I cannot but think that the authorities under whose
  sanction I have acted might be considered a sufficient
  defence against objections to the movement which I call for
  so pertinaciously. I will, however, proceed to answer
  one by one the remarks which I supposed in my last
  letter might be passed on my narrative of proceedings
  at Vienna. First, I supposed some would smile at
  my ignorance of the world, in expecting that in our
  days young princes like the Emperor of Austria and his
  brother should have any dispositions to enter into ideas like
  mine. But why not? Are they not good ideas? at least, I
  think them so; and am I to think a person incapable of
  great and good designs because he is an emperor&mdash;a prince?
  There is no doubt that because he is a prince, he is
  immensely more responsible for the objects which he pursues;
  and that the glory of God would be incomparably more
  advanced by his devoting himself to heavenly pursuits than
  if he were an ordinary person; and are we tamely to surrender
  to the service of the world, and of the Prince of this
  world, all who have power to influence the world, and be
  content on God's behalf to have none but the poor and weak
  on the other side? I know it is in the Word of God that
  not many wise, not many noble, &amp;c., are called. God has
  chosen the poor in this world; but yet there has been a St.
  Henry, an emperor; a St. Stephen, King of Hungary; a
  St. Louis of France; a St. Edward the Confessor, and so
  many more; and what magnificent instruments have such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">{440}</a></span>
  men been for exalting the Church, converting nations, and
  saving souls! If they have been few in comparison with
  kings and emperors whose views have been all temporal, is
  that a reason against trying to add one or two more to their
  number? I think it is a reason why we <i>should</i> try; and if
  we are to try, let us do it in the spirit of hope, or we shall
  do it very languidly. If after all we fail, what have we lost
  by trying and by hoping? You may answer, we shall suffer
  disappointment. Ah! who says that? No! no disappointment
  for those who hope in God and work for Him legitimately.
  It would make my heart bleed, if I had a heart fit
  for it, to think of the noble, truly princely youths in question,
  sinking down to the wretched level of worldly, selfish,
  immoral, useless men of power, of whom the world has
  borne so many; and for a time, if but for a time, I have
  indulged bright visions about them; not mere dreamy visions,
  for their education, the circumstances of their elevation, the
  young Emperor's career hitherto, his late wonderful deliverance
  from assassination, in which he behaved, as report says,
  in away to encourage all such thoughts as mine&mdash;all these
  are reasons on my side; but suppose I am disappointed there;
  suppose no one sympathizes in my thoughts; suppose the
  Emperor has forgotten all about my appeal, and I never
  travel more, or never more to Vienna, and no one else will
  take any trouble about it&mdash;is God's arm shortened? Are
  there no other emperors, or kings, or queens for Him to
  choose among, if emperors He has need of for the work?
  My friends, fear not. I do not intend to be disappointed,
  and, what is more, I shall not be, nor will any of those be
  who work for the saving of souls, even on the very largest
  scale, unless we are so foolish as to turn back and grow
  slack. But is it not an error, it will be asked, a mistake to
  wish kings and emperors to interfere in such things? I
  know many persons of great consideration have this thought;
  but the mistake seems to me to lie in not making a distinction
  between such interference as that of Constantius,
  Valens, Julian, in old times; Henry IV. and Joseph II. of
  Austria, Henry VIII. of England, and that of such princes
  as I have named above, whom the Church has canonized for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
  what they did for her. This is my opinion, others have
  theirs; how shall we decide? Can we here again know the
  mind of Rome; and will not that have some weight in
  settling the question? I will just relate what took place
  there relative to this matter. When preparing to leave
  Rome for Vienna, I desired to obtain from the Austrian
  Ambassador there a letter, which might facilitate my access
  to the Emperor, on which I had set my heart. But I
  understood the Ambassador himself was not easily accessible,
  and that I had better obtain a note of introduction to him,
  and from no one would it be so desirable as from Cardinal
  Antonelli, the Pope's Secretary of State. I obtained an
  audience from him and made my request. He answered:
  "We have a nuncio at Vienna; it will do better for you to
  have a letter from me to him." Of course I accepted this
  spontaneous offer most thankfully. The Cardinal desired
  me to tell him what I wished at Vienna, I said: "An audience
  of the Emperor: and as I am asking the favour of your
  Eminence to assist me in obtaining it, it seems right you
  should know for what end I desire it. It is to propose to
  the Emperor to take to heart my great object of the conversion
  of England, and of Protestants in general, and to move
  his subjects to it." The Cardinal explained to me some
  circumstances in the position of the Emperor, which made it
  unlikely that he would be led to take any open steps of this
  kind; but he gave me the letter without a word of objection
  to my wish, on principle; and it was on my presenting
  it to the Nuncio, that he most graciously desired that I
  should lodge in his palace all the time that I was in Vienna.
  As I have been led to mention this audience with Cardinal
  Antonelli, I think others may share with me in the feelings
  of satisfaction and admiration with which the remainder of
  what passed impressed me. I took occasion from finding
  myself in company with the Pope's Secretary of State, to
  make an additional effort towards moving Rome in the great
  cause; and as, by his office, he had to regard the political
  effect of a decided movement such as I was begging, I urged
  my conviction that no political ill consequences need be
  feared from the Holy Father calling on all Christendom to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">{442}</a></span>
  move in this spiritual enterprise. He interrupted me with
  saying: "The Holy Father fears no man and nothing in the
  world." He adverted to the position in which he had seen
  him at Gata, and said: "The political power of the Holy
  See depends on its weakness." I do not remember the
  exact words; but they amounted to a noble adoption by the
  Apostolic See of the famous Apostolic sentiment: "When
  I am weak, then am I strong," in relation not only to the
  wielding of its own inalienable spiritual sovereignty, but to
  its accidental temporal power, in the exercise of which we
  perhaps should not expect always to see the Divine principle
  so prominent. This discourse gave me the consoling assurance
  that when the mind of his Holiness should be guided
  by the light which is in him, to judge that the time is come
  for a powerful call on Christendom to move forward in the
  great enterprise, no human considerations will check his
  steps. The Holy Father knows no fear of man.

<p>
The joyous way in which he received crosses and mortifications
may be seen from this letter. It seemed as if
nothing could ruffle his temper. He remarks on the Proclamation,
in a letter he wrote to make arrangements for
saying mass in a private chapel: "There ought to be something
in the way of a cassock too, as the Queen and Lord
Derby have been pleased to make the country too hot for
me to keep on my wearing of the habit for the present. At
least so it seems."

<p>
When he attended the meeting of our Fathers, alluded to
above, he travelled by train, with his habit slung over his
shoulder, and the sign conspicuous, saying, "Since they won't
let me wear my habit like a religious, I shall carry it like a
slave."

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br>
A Little Of His Home And Foreign Work.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Father Ignatius gives a retreat to the nuns of Lingdale
House, and comes immediately after to Oscott, where the
first Provincial Synod of the English Hierarchy was being
held. He presents a petition to the Synodal Fathers, and
receives encouragement to prosecute his work of moving all
whom he can to pray for the conversion of England. His
next mission was to make the visitation of our Belgian
houses for the Provincial; when he found himself again
abroad, he took advantage of the opportunity. He goes to
different places, and finds many Belgian and French bishops
who preach upon his <i>oeuvre</i>, and recommend it by circulars
to their clergy. These journeys he paid for by begging
wherever he went, and the object he begged for is seen
from a letter of his to Mr. Monteith, dated Lille, Aug. 24,
1852:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My dear Mr. Monteith,&mdash;Here I am, writing to you
  again, and you will soon see that what brings me to this is,
  as usual, want of money&mdash;<i>auri fames</i>. The case stands
  thus: I am on travel again, with commission of finding
  means to build our house near London, of which I am
  rector, or rather I am rector of a little place which stands
  on the ground, and erecter rather than rector <i>ex officio</i> of
  the house that is to be there. I have my ideas how we
  might get means for this expense, and for all other expenses;
  and, moreover, how means could be got for all the houses in
  England and Scotland too. I am following the end as well
  as I can, all alone, by the way which seems to me the best
  and only one; but my being alone makes the progress slow.
  Hitherto, my ideas are to others like dreams&mdash;empty dreams,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">{444}</a></span>
  though I have a pocket-book full of recommendations from
  Rome to support them, which encourage me to think I am
  not mad, when, by the manner in which I see people sometimes
  look at me, I should almost think I was. I allude
  chiefly to the way in which, in a company of English
  Catholics, the mention from me of the idea, <i>conversion of
  England</i>, immediately silences a company in the most animated
  conversation, as if I had said, 'Next week I am
  going to be crowned King of France!' ... Though I speak
  as I do, I am not without encouragement and fine prospects;
  but I want to hasten things, as souls by thousands and millions
  perish by delays; and this I will not, if I can help it,
  have to answer for. An Englishman's regular, natural way
  to get his matters attended to, is a steady, persevering
  grumble. He grumbles over one step, then grumbles over
  the next, however comfortable and happy he may be over
  what he has gained.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Last week I was at Cambrai, where there was a most
  remarkable centenary feast, in honour of Notre Dame de
  Grce. There is there an old picture of Our Lady, brought
  from Rome 400 years ago, and installed in the cathedral in
  1452, which has been a centre of devotion ever since. This
  was the year for the grand solemnity; pilgrimages coming
  all the week from the diocese and farther. The most remarkable
  of the pilgrims unquestionably was Cardinal Wiseman,
  who came to preside over the procession and solemnities of
  the last day. He sung mass, and preached his first sermon
  in France, which was one of the most eloquent I ever heard
  from him, or any one, notwithstanding his imperfect diction.
  It was all to the point of moving the French Episcopate
  and nation to prayers for the conversion of England. So,
  if I live, I have little or no doubt of succeeding in time,
  but, meanwhile, I must poke here and poke there for money,
  till it begins to come freely of itself. As to what the Continent
  could do if their heart was once moved, I am convinced
  by the history of the Crusades. If the Catholic nations
  were now engaged in a material war, there would be armies
  on foot, and fleets at sea, the cost of which, for one week,
  would be enough to build cathedrals for all our bishops.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">{445}</a></span>
  Why not the same money drawn to effect the spiritual conquest?
  Because they do not care about it. Then, let us
  make them; and how? The first step, of course, must be
  to care for it ourselves. '<i>Si vis me flere, dolendum est primum
  ipsi tibi.</i>' And what can we do to bring our English and
  Scotch to this?&mdash;Grumble at them, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
On his return from France in September, himself and
Father Eugene came to the determination to move away
from The Hyde, if a more convenient site could be procured.
The reason of this was chiefly the unsuitableness of
the place to the working of our vocation. It was too solitary
for missionaries, and there was no local work for a
number of priests. Some of the fathers disguise themselves
in secular suits, less unseemly than that in which they once
beheld Father Ignatius, and go in search of a place, but
without success. Father Ignatius gave a mission at this
time in Kentish Town, and he little thought, as he took his
walk along the tarred paling in Maiden Lane, that inside
lay the grounds of the future St. Joseph's Retreat.
</p>
<p>
Towards the end of the year 1852, Father Ignatius
accompanies as far as London Bridge a colony of Passionists,
whom Dr. O'Connor, the Bishop of Pittsburg, was bringing
out to the United States. These Passionists have grown
in <i>gentem magnam</i>, and the worthy Bishop, like another
Odescalchi, resigned his crosier, and became a Jesuit.
</p>
<p>
He concludes this year and begins the next giving
retreats. The scenes of his labours in this department were
Somers Town, Blandford Square (London), our own house,
Dudley, and Douay. He also assisted at a mission in
Commercial Road, London, E.
</p>
<p>
The heaviest part of his work, as a member of The Hyde
community, was attending to the parish, which, with the
Barnet Mission, then under our charge, was equal in area
to many a diocese in Catholic countries. Father Ignatius
often walked thirty miles in one day on parochial duty.
To give an idea of how he went through this work, one
instance will suffice. On one day to went to Colney Hatch
Lunatic Asylum, and from all the unhappy inmates he was
able to get one confession. Next day he walked to give
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
the Holy Communion to this single penitent, and walked
afterwards to Barnet before he broke his fast. This must
be a distance of at least fifteen miles.
</p>
<p>
In May, 1853, he gives a retreat to his old parishioners
of West Bromwich, another in Winchester in July, to the
nuns in Wolverhampton in August, and to the people in
Oxburgh in October, and in Southport, Lancashire, in
Advent.
</p>
<p>
The 16th of November this year was a great day for our
congregation. It was the first feast of Blessed Paul of the
Cross, our holy founder. There was a great re-union of the
chief fathers of the order in St. Wilfrid's&mdash;the Bishops of
Birmingham and Southwark, and Dr. Ullathorne and Dr.
Grant assisted at the solemnity. Father Ignatius was
there, of course. Father Paul was beatified on the 28th
September, 1852. Our religious had prayed and worked
for the great event, and had now the happiness of seeing
him raised to the altar.
</p>
<p>
He stays at home a great deal now, as a rector ought to
do, except in intervals of missions and retreats; and the
lion's share of parish work falls to him. He sends one of
the priests of his community to France to beg for the house;
but he had, in a very short time, to send him money for
his expenses home. He then concludes that he should
himself be considered beggar-in-chief, and accordingly goes
out for a few days to collect alms in London. With his
alms, he collects into the Church a young Puseyite minister,
who is now a zealous priest on the London mission.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius visits the neighbouring ministers, but not
as formerly; he simply goes to see his old acquaintances, and
if the conversation could be transferred from compliments
and common-place remarks to matters of higher interest, he
was not the man to let the opportunity pass by. Among
his old friends in the Anglican ministry there seemed to have
been few for whom he always cherished so kindly a regard
as the Rev. Mr. Harvey, Rector of Hornsey. That excellent
clergyman used to visit Father Ignatius, and receive visits
from him on the most friendly terms to the end.
</p>
<p>
Thus did he spend his time, until Father Pius, the brother
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">{447}</a></span>
of our present General, who died in Rome in 1864, came
to visit the province, or branch of the order in England, in
1854. This visit made a change in Father Ignatius's
position.
</p>
<p>
A number of houses of a religious order are placed under
the direction of one superior, who is styled a Provincial.
With us the Provincial has two assistants, who are called
Consultors. The superior of each house is called a Rector,
and it is his duty to see after the spiritual and temporal
concerns of his own community. A rector, therefore, has
more home work, by virtue of his office, than any other
superior. A consultor may live in any house of the province,
has no special duty <i>ex officio</i> except to give his advice
to the Provincial when asked, and may be easily spared for
any external employment. This office Father Ignatius used
to term as <i>otium cum dignitate</i>, though the <i>otium</i> he never
enjoyed, and felt rather awkward in the <i>dignitas</i>.
</p>
<p>
In 1854, he was made first Consultor, and relieved from
the drudgery of housekeeping for his brethren. Before
leaving The Hyde for a new field of labour, he went to see
his nephew in Harrow, which was only a few miles from
our retreat; but was not admitted. He took another priest
with him, and both were hooted by the boys. It seems
pardonable in a set of wild young schoolboys to make game
of such unfashionable beings as Catholic priests; but it shows
a great want of good breeding in schoolboys who are afterwards
to hold such a high position in English society. This
remark is forced upon us by the fact that none of us ever
passed through Harrow without meeting a somewhat similar
reception. A school of inferior rank might set Harrow an
example in this point. We have passed Roger Cholmley's
school in Highgate, time after time, often in a large body,
and have met the boys in threes and fours, and all together,
and never yet heard a single insult. What makes the
difference?
</p>
<p>
On the 8th of September, 1854, Father Ignatius left The
Hyde for Ireland. He begs this time through the principal
towns in Munster, and says he was very kindly received by
all. He preached sermons during this journey, all on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">{448}</a></span>
conversion of England. He gained more prayers this time
than on a former occasion, because his work came to the
people with blessings and indulgences from the Father of
the Faithful. He used to tell an amusing anecdote in
reference to this mission. Somewhere he had preached on the
conversion of England, and recommended the prayers by
the spiritual profit to be derived from them. An old
woman accosted him as he was passing by, and he had just
time to hear, "Father, I say the three Hail Marys every
day for England." Father Ignatius was much pleased, and
made inquiries after the old lady, doubtless intending to
constitute her a kind of apostle in the place. She was
brought to see him; he expressed his thanks and pleasure
that she had entered so thoroughly into his views, and asked
her would she try to persuade others to follow her example?
"Me get people to pray for England!" she answered; "I
pray myself three times for the sake of the indulgence, but
I curse them 300 times a day for it, lest they might get any
good of my prayers!" He reasoned with her, to be sure,
but did not tell us if the success of his second discourse was
equal to the first.
</p>

<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
Sanctification Of Ireland.</h2>
<br>
<p>
In a letter written by Father Ignatius in December, 1854,
is found the first glimpse of a new idea: the Sanctification
of Ireland. This idea was suggested to him by the faith of
the Irish people, and by their readiness to adopt whatever was
for their spiritual profit. His intending the Sanctification
of Ireland as a step towards the Conversion of England,
laid the scheme open to severe criticism. It was said that
England was his final object; that Ireland was to be used
as an instrument for England's benefit; that if his patriotism
were less strong, his sanctity would be greater. If these
objections were satisfactorily answered, they might be given
up with a hint that, "it was a very Irish way to convert
England, by preaching in the bogs of Connaught." The
best refutation of these ungenerous remarks will be, perhaps,
a simple statement of what his ideas were upon the subject.
His great desire was that all the world should be perfect.
He used to say Our Lord had not yet had His triumph in
this world, and that it was too bad the devil should still
have the majority. "This must not be," he would say;
"I shall never rest as long as there is a single soul on earth
who does not serve God perfectly." The practical way of
arriving at this end was to begin at home. England had
not faith as a nation, so there was no foundation to build
sanctity upon there. England, however, had great influence
as a nation all over the world; she showed great zeal also
in her abortive attempts to convert the heathen. If her
energies could be turned in the right direction, what grand
results might we not anticipate? Another reflection was,
England has had every means of conversion tried upon her;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">{450}</a></span>
let us now see what virtue there is in good example. To
set this example, and to sow the seed of the great universal
harvest, he would find out the best Catholic nation in the
world, and bring it perfectly up to the maxims of the Gospel.
This nation was Ireland, of course, and it was near enough
to England to let its light shine before her. What he wished
for was, to have every man, woman, and child in Ireland,
take up the idea that they were to be saints. He would
have this caught up with a kind of national move. The
practical working of the idea he embodied in a little book
which he wrote some time afterwards, and preached it
wherever he addressed an Irish congregation. The banishing
of three great vices&mdash;cursing, company-keeping, and
intemperance&mdash;and the practice of daily meditation, with a
frequent approach to the sacraments, were the means. If
Ireland, so he argued, took up this at home, it would spread
to England, the colonies, and to wherever there was an
Irishman all over the world. All these would be shining
lights, and if their neighbours did not choose at once to
follow their example, we could at least point it out as the
best proof of our exhortations. This is a short sketch of
the work he now began, and it was a work his superiors
always encouraged, and which he spent his life in
endeavouring to realise.
</p>
<p>
One objection made against this scheme touched him on
a tender point&mdash;his love of country. Many Catholics, especially
English converts, thought the words of Ecclesiasticus
applicable to England: "Injuries and wrongs will waste
riches: and the house that is very rich shall be brought to
nothing by pride: so the substance of the proud shall be
rooted out."&mdash;Eccl. xxi. 5. These were of opinion that
England must be humbled as a nation, and deeply too, before
she could be fit for conversion. This Father Ignatius could
not stand. He writes, in a letter to Mr. Monteith: "As
my <i>unicum necessarium</i> for myself is the salvation and
sanctification of my own soul, so my wishes and designs
about England, which, according to the order of charity, I
consider (in opposition to many English Catholics, especially
converts), I ought to love first of all people, are, singly and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">{451}</a></span>
only, that she may be brought to God, and in such a way
and under such circumstances, as may enable her to be the
greatest possible blessing to the whole world. I have heard
plenty, and much more than plenty, from English and Irish
Catholics (very seldom, comparatively, from those of the
Continent), about the impossibility of this, except by the
thorough crushing of the power of England. I say to all
this, <i>No, no, no!</i> God can convert our country with her
power and her influence unimpaired, and I insist on people
praying for it without imposing conditions on Almighty
God, on whom, if I did impose conditions, it would be in
favour of His showing more, and not less abundant, mercy
to a fallen people. Yet, though I have often said I will not
allow Miss This, or Mr. That, to pronounce sentence on
England, still less to wish evil to her (particularly if it be
an English Mr. or Miss who talks), I have always said
that if God sees it fit that the conversion should be through
outward humiliations and scourges, I will welcome the rod,
and thank Him for it, in behalf of my country, as I would
in my own person, in whatever way He might think fit to
chastise and humble me."
</p>
<p>
He returned to London in the beginning of 1855, to give
the retreat to our religious. His next work was a mission,
given with Father Gaudentius in Stockport. After that, he
gave a mission with Father Vincent in Hull; in returning
from Hull, he stopped at Lincoln to visit Mr. Sibthorpe.
He spends a week in our London house, and then gives a
retreat by himself in Trelawny. His next mission was in
Dungannon, Ireland, and as soon as he came to England for
another retreat he had to give in Levenshulme to nuns, he
takes advantage of his week's rest to visit Grace Dieu, and
have what he calls "a famous talk" with Count de Montalembert,
who was Mr. Phillipps's guest at the time.
</p>
<p>
The scene of his labours is again transferred. We find
him in July giving a mission at Borris O'Kane, with Father
Vincent and Father Bernard  and another immediately after,
at Lorrha. At one of these missions, the crowd about Father
Ignatius's confession-chair was very great, and the people
were crushing in close to the confessor's knees. One woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">{452}</a></span>
especially, of more than ordinary muscular strength, elbowed
back many of those who had taken their places before she
came; she succeeded in getting to the inner circle of penitents,
but so near the person confessing that the good father
gently remonstrated with her. All to no purpose. He
spoke again, but she only came nearer. At length he seized
her shawl, rolled it up in a ball, and flung it over the heads
of the crowd; the poor woman had to relinquish her position,
and go for her shawl, and left Father Ignatius to shrive
her less pushing companions. His fellow missioners were
highly amused, and this incident tells wonderfully for his
virtue, for it is almost the only instance we could ever find
of his having done anything like losing his temper during
his life as a Passionist. He gives a retreat in Birr, in
Grantham Abbey, a mission in Newcastle, and another in
St. Augustine's, Liverpool, before the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
It was his custom, since his first turning seriously to God's
service, to be awake at midnight on New Year's Day, and
begin by prayer for passing the coming year perfectly. He
is in St. Anne's, Sutton, Lancashire, this year. He begins
the new year, 1856, by giving a mission with Father
Leonard in our church at Sutton, with a few sermons at a
place called Peasly Cross, an offshoot of the mission we have
there.
</p>
<p>
We close this chapter by a notion of Father Ignatius's
politics. He was neither a Whig, a Tory, nor a Radical.
He stood aloof from all parties, and seldom troubled himself
about any. He says in a letter to a friend who was a well-read
politician:&mdash;"How many minds we have speaking in
England!&mdash;Gladstone, Palmerston, Bright, Phillipps, yourself,
and, perhaps, I should add myself, and how many more
who knows? all with minds following tracks which make
them travel apart from each other. I want to set a road
open, in which all may walk together if they please&mdash;at least
with one foot, if they must have their own particular plank
for the other."
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">{453}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
Another Tour On The Continent.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The Provincial once more sent Father Ignatius to beg on
the Continent. He tried to do a double work, as he did not
like to be "used up" for begging alone, and the plea of
begging would find him access to those he intended to consult.
This second work was a form into which he cast his
ideas for the sanctification of the world. The way of carrying
out these ideas, which has been detailed, was what he
settled down to after long discussion and many corrections
from authority. The pamphlet which he now wrote had been
translated into German by a lady in Mnster. In it he proposes
a bringing back of Catholics to the infancy of the Church,
when the faithful laid the price of their possessions at the
feet of the Apostles. He proposed a kind of Theocracy,
and the scheme creates about the same sensation as Utopia,
when one reads it. Like Sir Thomas More, Father Ignatius
gives us what he should consider a perfect state of Christian
society; he goes into all the details of its working, and
meets the objections that might arise as it proceeds. The
pamphlet is entitled <i>Reflectiones Propositionesque pro fidelium
Sanctificatione</i>."
</p>
<p>
On February 14, 1856, he leaves London, and halts in
Paris only for a few hours, on his way to Marseilles. There
he sees the Archbishop, and begs in the town; he returns
then to Lyons, where he has several long conferences with
Cardinal de Bonald. We find him in Paris in a few days,
writing circulars to the French bishops, of whom the Bishop
of Nancy seems to have been his greatest patron. He writes
a letter to the Empress, and receives an answer that the
Emperor would admit him to an audience. In a day or two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">{454}</a></span>
Father Ignatius stands in the presence of Napoleon III.,
and it is a loss that he has not left us the particulars of the
conference in writing, because he often reverted to it in
conversation with a great deal of interest. He found at his
lodgings, on returning from a <i>qute</i> a few days after, l,000f.
sent to him as a donation by the Emperor.
</p>
<p>
His good success in the Tuileries gave him a hope of doing
great things among the <i>lite</i> of Parisian society. He is,
however, sadly disappointed, and the next day sets off to
Belgium.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in Tournai, he sends a copy of the French circular
to the Belgian bishops. This does not seem to be a
petition for alms, as we find him the same evening travelling
in a third-class carriage to Cologne, without waiting for
their Lordships' answers.
</p>
<p>
During his begging in Cologne, he says mass every morning
in St. Colomba's (Columb-Kille's) Church; perhaps the
spirit of hospitality was bequeathed to the clergy of this
Church by their Irish patron, for he appears to have
experienced some coldness from the <i>pfarren</i> of Cologne.
</p>
<p>
In Mnster he is very well received. The Bishop is
particularly kind to him, and looks favourably on his <i>Reflectiones</i>;
besides that, his lordship deputes a priest to be his
guide in begging. Father Ignatius notes in his journal that
he preached extempore in German to the Jesuit novices, and
that one of the fathers revises and corrects the German
translation of the <i>Reflectiones</i>. The priest deputed for guide
by the Bishop of Mnster was called away on business of
importance, and Father Ignatius finds another. This Kaplan
"lost his time smoking," and our good father gave up, and
went off by Kln to Coblentz.
</p>
<p>
He finds the bishop here very kind, but is allowed to beg
only of the clergy; the Jesuits give him hospitality. A
cold reception in Mantz, and a lukewarm one in Augsburg,
hurry him off to Munich. He submits the <i>Reflectiones</i>
to Dr. Dllinger, who corrects them and gives them his
approbation.
</p>
<p>
From Munich he proceeds to Vienna. A part of this
journey, as far as Lintz, had to be performed by an <i>eilwayen</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">{455}</a></span>
or post car. The driver of this vehicle was a tremendous
smoker, and Father Ignatius did not at all enjoy the fumes
of tobacco. He perceived that the driver forgot the pipe,
which he laid down at a <i>hoff</i> on the way, while slaking his
thirst, and never told him of it. He was exulting in the
hope of being able to travel to the next shop for pipes without
inhaling tobacco smoke, when, to his mortification, the
driver perceived his loss, and shouted out like a man in despair,
<i>Mein pfeiffe! Mein pfeiffe!</i>&mdash;My pipe! My pipe! To
increase his passenger's disappointment, he actually turned
back a full German league, and then smoked with a vengeance
until he came to the next stage.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius sends a copy of the <i>Reflectiones</i> to Rome,
on his arrival in Vienna, and presents it with an address at
an assembly of Bishops that was then being held.
</p>
<p>
He has audiences with the Emperor and Archduke Maximilian,
now Emperor of Mexico, as well as with the Nunzio,
and all the notabilities, clerical and secular, in the city.
</p>
<p>
Immediately after, somehow, he gets notice to quit from
the Superior of a religious community, where he had been
staying, and all the other religious houses refuse to take him
in. He was about to leave Vienna in consequence, as he did
not like putting up in an hotel, when some Italian priests
gave him hospitality, and welcomed him to stop with them as
long as he pleased. As a set-off to his disappointment, the
Bishop of Transylvania is very kind to him, and Cardinal
Schwartzenberg even begs for him. He met the Most
Rev. Father Jandel, General of the Dominicans, in the
Cardinal's Palace, and showed him the <i>Reflectiones</i>. The
good disciple of St. Thomas examined the document closely,
and Father Ignatius records his opinion, "he gave my paper
a kick." Notwithstanding this sentence, he went on distributing
copies every where; but his tract-distribution was
stopped in a few days by a letter he received from our
General.
</p>
<p>
When he sent the little pamphlet to Rome it was handed
for criticism to the Lector (or Professor) of Theology in our
retreat, who was then Father Ignatius Paoli, the present
Provincial in England. The critique was very long and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">{456}</a></span>
quite unfavourable; it reached him, backed by a letter from
the General, which forbade to speak about the counsels for
the present. He records this sentence in his journal in these
words:&mdash;"June 17. A letter from Padre Ignazio, by the
General&mdash;Order to stop speaking of the counsels, &amp;c. <i>Stop
her, back her. Deo gratias!"</i> This was a favourite expression
with him whenever a Superior thwarted any of his projects:
it was borrowed from the steamboats that ply on the Thames,
and Father Ignatius considered himself as in the position of
the little boy who echoes the orders of the master to the
engineers below. He used to say, "What a catastrophe
might one expect if the boy undertook to give an order of
his own!"
</p>
<p>
Whilst in Vienna he received a letter from Father Vincent,
telling him of our having established a house of the
order near Harold's Cross, Dublin. Father Ignatius
accompanied Father Vincent when they were both in Dublin,
before the German tour began, in his search for a position,
and Rathmines was selected. The excellent parish priest,
Monsignor Meagher, had just opened his new church, and
laboured hard to have a religious community in his district.
He therefore seconded the intentions of our people, and in a
short time a house was taken in his parish, and every day
cements the connexion between us and this venerable ecclesiastic.
A splendid edifice has since been built during the
Rectorship of Father Osmond, and chiefly through his
exertions.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius went to two or three towns, where the
police would not allow him to beg unless patronised by a
native priest, and not being able to fulfil these conditions he
was obliged to desist.
</p>
<p>
This was Father Ignatius's last visit to Germany; he had
been there five times during his life. The first was a tour
of pleasure, all the rest were for higher objects. He seems
to have had a great regard for the Germans; he considered
them related by blood to the English, and although he himself
was of Norman descent, he appears to have a special
liking for the Saxon element in character. He preferred to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">{457}</a></span>
see it blended certainly, and would consider a vein of Celtic
or Norman blood an improvement on the Teutonic.
</p>
<p>
There were other reasons. St. Boniface, the Apostle of
Germany, was an Englishman; St. Columbanus and St.
Gall might be said to have laboured more in Germany than
in their native Ireland. The Germans owed something to
England, and he wished to have them make a return. Besides,
the Reformation began in Germany, and he would
have the countrymen of Luther and of Cranmer work
together to repair the injuries they had suffered from each
other. This twofold plea was forced upon him by a German
periodical, which advocated the cause of the "Crusade"
even so far back as 1838. Father Ignatius also knew how
German scholarship was tinging the intellect of England,
and he thought a spread of devotion would be the best
antidote to Rationalism. The reasons for working in France,
which he styled "that generous Catholic nation," were somewhat
different, but they have been detailed by himself in
those portions of the correspondence respecting his crusade.
</p>
<p>
He visits Raal, Resburg, Baden, Ratisbonne, and Munich;
hence he starts for London. Here he arrives on the 4th
of October. He did not delay, but went straight to Dublin,
and stayed for the first time in Blessed Paul's Retreat,
Harold's Cross. This house became his head-quarters for
some time, for we find him returning thither after a mission
in Kenilworth, and one in Liverpool, as well as a retreat
for nuns, which closes his labours for the year 1856.
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">{458}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br>
Father Ignatius In 1857.
</h2>
<br>
<p>
Seven years, according to physiologists, make a total change
in the human frame, such is the extent of the renewal; and
although the laws of spirit do not follow those of matter, it
may be a pleasing problem to find out how far there is an
analogy. The chapter of 1850 was headed like this; let us
see if the events of both tell differently upon Father
Ignatius.
</p>
<p>
The first event he records in the Journal for this year is
the reception of Mrs. O'Neill into the Church. This good
lady had then one son a Passionist; she was what might be
called a very strict and devoted Protestant, although all her
children were brought up Catholics by her husband. She
loved the son who first joined our order very tenderly, and
felt his becoming a monk so much that she would never read
one of his letters. The son was ordained priest in Monte-Argentaro,
and the first news he heard after he had for the
first time offered up the Holy Sacrifice, was that his mother
had been received in our retreat in Dublin by Father Ignatius.
She was induced by another son, who lived in Dublin,
to attend benediction, and our Lord gave her the grace of
conversion with His blessing. She is now a fervent Catholic,
and another son and a daughter have since followed the
example of their brother. The mother finds her greatest
happiness in what once seemed her greatest affliction. Such
is the power of grace, always leading to joy through the
bitterness of the cross.
</p>
<p>
The next event is the death of Father Paul Mary of St.
Michael. This saintly Passionist was the Honourable Charles
Reginald Packenham, son of the Earl of Longford. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">{459}</a></span>
became a convert when captain in the Guards, and shortly
after joined our Institute. He was the first rector of Blessed
Paul's Retreat, and having edified his brethren by his
humility and religious virtues for nearly six years, the term
of his life as a Passionist, died in the odour of sanctity. He
had been ailing for some time, but still able to do a little
in the way of preaching and confessions. It was advertised
that he would preach in Gardiner Street, Dublin, on Sunday,
March 1. He died that day at one o'clock A.M., and Father
Ignatius went to preach in his stead; it created a sensation
when the good father began by asking prayers for the repose
of the soul of him whose place he came to fill.
</p>
<p>
In a letter Father Ignatius wrote at this time we have his
opinion of Father Paul Mary: ".... As to the Passionists,
I do not think those who managed our coming here (to
Dublin) which was all done during my absence in Germany,
had any idea of serving England. I believe the prime instigator
of the move was Father Paul Mary, who was born in
Dublin, and was through and through an Irishman in his
affections, though trained in England. He, to the last, had
all the anti-English feelings, which prevail so much through
Ireland, and never would give me the least hope of his
being interested for England. I fall in, notwithstanding
that, with all the notions of his great virtue and holiness
which others have; and I think, moreover, that the best
Catholics in Ireland are to be found among those who have
been the most bitterly prejudiced against England. But I
think there is in reserve for them another great step in
advance when they lay down this aversion and turn it into
divine charity in a heroic degree."
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius always felt keenly Father Paul Mary's
not taking up his ideas about England with more warmth.
When he was on his death-bed, Father Ignatius spent
many hours sitting by him. In one of their last conversations,
Father Ignatius urged his pleas for England as
strongly as he could; when he had done, and was waiting
for the effect, Father Paul said, in a dry, cold manner: "I
don't think Ireland has got anything to thank England for."
These words were perpetually ringing in the ears of Father
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">{460}</a></span>
Ignatius; they were the last Father Paul ever said on the
subject, and the other used to say: "Oh, I used to enjoy
his beautiful conversation so much, but I never could hear
one single kind word for England."
</p>
<p>
This year a general chapter of our Congregation was held
in Rome. This is an important event, and only occurs
every six years. It is here the head superiors are elected,
points of rule explained, and regulations enacted for the
better ordering of the different houses all over the world,
according to circumstances of time and place. The Provincial
and the two Consultors of each Province are obliged
to attend. Father Ignatius was therefore called to travel
abroad once more. When in Rome, he employed all the
time that was left from capitular duties in holding conferences
with our students, and trying to get some papers he brought
with him approved. Among others, he brought the paper
that was "kicked" by Father Jaudel, and condemned by
one of our theologians. The only one in Rome who approved
of it was the Abbate Passaglia. Cardinal Barnab listened
to all Father Ignatius had to urge in its favour; but did
not approve of it. He had to return without gaining
anything this time; except that the Roman Lector was
become his Provincial. In a few years afterwards, when
we read of Passaglia's fall, Father Ignatius was heard to
say: "Passaglia and Dllinger were the only theologians
who approved of my paper. I suppose I need not flatter
myself much upon their <i>imprimatur</i>."
</p>
<p>
He was remarked to be often abstracted when he had
many crosses to bear. One day he was going through Rome
with one of our Religious, and passed by a fountain. He
went over and put his hand so far into one of the jets, that
he squirted the water over a number of poor persons who
were basking in the sun a few steps beneath him. They
made a stir, and uttered a few oaths as the water kept dashing
down on them. The companion awoke Father Ignatius
out of his reverie, and so unconscious did he seem of the
disturbance he had unwittingly created, that he passed on
without alluding to it.
</p>
<p>
On his return home now, as Second Consultor, he is sent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">{461}</a></span>
to beg again in Ireland. He makes the circuit of Connaught
this time. He took, in his journey, Roscommon,
Castlerea, visits the O'Connor Don, Boyle, Sligo. Here he
was received very kindly by the Bishop and clergy. He
had for guide in Sligo, a Johnny Doogan, who seems to have
amused him very much. This good man was chief respondent
at the Rosary, which used to be said every evening in
the church. One night the priest began, "Incline unto my
aid, O Lord." No answer. "Where are you, Johnny
Doogan?" asked the priest. Johnny, who was a little more
than distracted in some corner of the church, replied, as if
suddenly awoke: "Here I am, your Reverence, and 'my
tongue shall announce thy praise.'" He next passes along
through Easky and Cullinamore to Ballina. He gives a
retreat to the Sisters of Mercy here, and during it, makes an
excursion to Enniscrone. He went next to Ballycastle,
Killala, Castlebar. Here he went to visit his cousin, Lord
Lucan, and is very kindly received. During the course of
conversation, he asked Lord Lucan if he had not heard of
his conversion? "Oh yes," he replied, "I heard you were
wavering some thirty years ago." "But I have not wavered
since," replied Father Ignatius. He then went to Ballinrobe,
Westport, Tuam, Athenry, and back to Dublin, by
Mullingar. This tour took nearly two months. He gives
a retreat in the beginning of September to the nuns of
Gorey, and after it, begs through Wexford, and the southwest
portion of Leinster. The only thing remarkable about
these excursions is, that he notes once, "I am ashamed to
think that I have not begged of any poor people to-day."
</p>
<p>
In December, 1857, his brother Frederick, Lord Spencer,
died. This brother was Father Ignatius's companion at
school, and it is remarkable that he was the only one of the
family who used any kind of severity towards him. He
says, in a letter written at this time, "I am twelve years an
exile from Althorp." Shortly before the Earl died, he
relented, and invited Father Ignatius to stay at the family
seat a few days. The letter joyfully accepting the invitation
was read by the brother on his bed of death. It is only
right to observe that the present Earl has been the kindest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">{462}</a></span>
of all, and treated his uncle with distinguished kindness for
the few years he was left to him. He even gave him back
the portion of his income which his father diverted to other
uses.
</p>
<p>
Another letter he wrote in December, gives an idea of his
spirit of resignation. It seems a Rev. Mother wrote to him
in a state of alarm that some of the sisters were inclined to
go away. Here is a part of his answer: "I will see what
I can do with the sisters who are in the mood to kick, bite,
or run away. If they take to running, never mind how
many go, let them all go, with <i>God bless them, and thank God
they are gone</i>, and we will hope their room will be worth as
much as their company."
</p>
<p>
Lest the allusion to his exile from Althorp might be taken
in a wrong sense, it is well to give a passage from a letter
Father Ignatius wrote after the death of his brother. "I
dare say you have not heard that just before my brother's
death I had written to him about a case of distress, which
he had before been acquainted with, telling him, at the same
time, of what I was about, and among other things, that I
was going to London to open a mission in Bermondsey on
the 10th of January. He sent me 3 for the person I
wrote about, and invited me to stop at Althorp a couple of
nights on my way, not demanding any positive promise
about religion as beforetime, but only saying that he thought
I might come as a private friend without seeing it necessary
to hold spiritual communications with the people in the
neighbourhood. I answered that I would come with pleasure
on these terms, and that even if he had said nothing, prudence
would dictate to me to act as he wished. This was a
most interesting prospect to me, after my twelve years' exile
from that home, and I intended to come on the 7th of
January. It was only a day or two before my leaving
Dublin for this journey, that I was shown a notice in the
paper of his death, and the next day had a letter about it
from my sister. He must have received my letter on the
very day that he was taken ill. These are remarkable
circumstances. What will Providence bring out of them?"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">{463}</a></span>
He felt the death of this brother very much, and was known
to shed tears in abundance when relating the sad news to
some of his friends. He said very sadly, "I gave myself up
to three days' sorrowing for my dear brother Frederick, but
I took care to thank God for the affliction."

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br>
His "Little Missions."</h2>
<br>
<p>
On the 21st of June, 1858, Father Ignatius began to give
short retreats, which he designated "little missions." This
was his work the remaining six years of his life; anything
else we find him doing was like an exception.
</p>
<p>
The work proposed in these missions was what has been
already described in the chapter on the sanctification of the
Irish people. He wanted to abolish all their vices, which he
reduced to three capital sins, and sow the seeds of perfect
virtue upon the ground of their deep and fertile faith. Since
he took up the notion that Ireland was called to keep among
the nations the title of <i>Island of Saints</i>, which had once
been hers, he could never rest until he saw it effected. He
seems to have been considering for a number of years the
means by which this should be brought about, and he hit
upon a happy thought in 1858.
</p>
<p>
This thought was the way of impregnating the minds of
all the Irish people with his ideas. He found that missions
were most powerful means of moving people in a body to
reconciliation with God, and an amendment of life. He
perceived that the words of the missionaries were treasured
up, and that the advices they gave were followed with a
scrupulous exactness. Missions were the moving power, but
how were they to enter into all the corners of a kingdom?
Missions could only be given in large parishes, and all priests
did not set so high a value upon their importance as those
who asked for them. If he could concentrate the missionary
power into something less solemn, but of like efficacy, and
succeed in carrying that out, he thought it would be just
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">{465}</a></span>
the thing. This train of deliberation resulted in the "little
missions."
</p>
<p>
A "little mission" is a new mode of renewing fervour;
Father Ignatius was the originator and only worker in it of
whom we have any record. It was half a week of missionary
work in every parish&mdash;that is, three days and a half
of preaching and hearing confessions. Two sermons in the
day were as much as ever Father Ignatius gave, and the
hours in the confessional were as many as he could endure.
</p>
<p>
This kind of work had its difficulties. The whole course
of subjects proper to a mission could not be got through,
neither could all the penitents be heard. Father Ignatius
met these objections. "The eternal truths," as such, he
did not introduce. He confined himself to seven lectures,
in which the crying evils, with their antidotes, were introduced.
As far as the confessions were concerned, he followed
the rule of moral theologians that a confessor is
responsible only for the penitent kneeling before him, and
not for those whose confession he has not begun. He heard
all he could.
</p>
<p>
His routine of daily work on these little missions was to
get up at five, and hear confessions all day until midnight,
except whilst saying mass and office, giving his lecture and
taking his meals. He took no recreation whatever, and if he
chatted any time after dinner with the priest, the conversation
might be considered a continuation of his sermon.
At a very moderate calculation he must have spent at least
twelve hours a day in the confessional. Some of these
apostolic visits he prolonged to a week when circumstances
required. He gave 245 of these missions from June, 1858,
to September, 1864; he was on his way to the 246th when
he died. A rough calculation will show us that he must
have spent about twenty-two weeks every year in this
employment. Let us just think of forty journeys, in cold
and heat, from parish to parish, sometimes on foot, sometimes
on conveyances, which chance put in his way. Let
us follow him when he has strapped his bags upon his
shoulder, after his mass, walking off nine or ten miles, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">{466}</a></span>
order to be in time to begin in another parish that evening.
Let us see the poor man trying to prevent his feeling pain
from his sore feet by walking a little faster, struggling, with
umbrella broken, against rain and wind, dust, a bad road,
and a way unknown to add to his difficulties. He arrives,
he lays down his burden, puts on his habit, takes some
dinner, finishes his office, preaches his first discourse, and
sits in the confessional until half-past eleven o'clock. Let
us try to realize what this work must have been, and we
shall have an idea of the six last years of Father Ignatius
Spencer's life.
</p>
<p>
We give a few extracts from his letters, as they will convey
an idea of how he felt and wrought in this great work.
</p>
<p>
On the 10th of August, 1858, he writes from the convent
in Kells, where he was helping the nuns through
their retreat:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I have an hour and a half before my next
  sermon at 7; all the nuns' confessions are finished, and all
  my office said; I have therefore time for a letter. I have
  not had such an afternoon as this for many months. The
  people of this town seem to think the convent an impregnable
  fortress, and do not make an assault upon me in it.
  If I was just to show myself in the church I should be
  quickly surrounded. The reflections which come upon me
  this quiet afternoon are not so bright and joyous as you
  might expect, perhaps, from the tone of my letter to
  M &mdash;&mdash;, but rather of a heavy afflicting character; but
  all the better, all the better. This is wholesome, and
  another stage in my thoughts brings me to very great satisfaction
  out of this heaviness. I do not know whether I
  shall explain myself to you. I see myself here so alone,
  though the people come upon me so eagerly, so warmly,
  and, I may say, so lovingly; yet I have not one on whom
  I can think as sympathising with me. I see the necessity
  of a complete radical change in the spirit of the people, the
  necessity, I mean, in order to have some prospect of giving
  the cause of truth its victory in England, and making this
  Irish people permanently virtuous and happy. This is
  what I am preaching from place to place, and aiming at
  instilling into the people's minds in the confessional, at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">{467}</a></span>
  dinner-tables, in cars on the road, as well as in preaching;
  and, while I aim at it, the work is bright enough."
</p>
<p>
Oct. 11, 1860, he writes:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I can hardly understand how
  I can go on for any long time more as I am doing, and not
  find some capable and willing to enter into them. Here I
  am through the 112th parish, with the same proposals which
  no one objects to, but no one enters into nor seems to
  understand."
</p>
<p>
May 6, 1861.&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It seems my lot to be moving about
  as long as I can move. I am very happy in the work I am
  about when I am at it, but I have always to go through
  regret and sorrow before moving, particularly when leaving
  my home. ... I have now gone through 132 parishes.
  No movement yet, such as I am aiming at. It always goes
  on in the form of most interesting missionary work, and is
  a most agreeable way of doing my begging work. I have
  been through 123 of these parishes without asking a penny
  from any one, but they bring me on an average more than
  21 a parish in <i>Ireland</i>. I have worked through eleven
  parishes in the diocese of Salford (England) out of that
  number, and these do not yield half the fruit of the Irish
  missions in point of money, but are otherwise very
  satisfactory.''
</p>
<p>
In a letter written in December of the same year:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I am preparing for another year's work like the last, going
  from parish to parish through Ireland, collecting for our
  Order, and at the same time stirring the people to devote
  themselves to their sanctification. They give their money
  very generously, they listen kindly to my sermons, and I
  never have a minute idle in hearing confessions; but hitherto
  there is no attention such as I wish paid to my proposals.
  I have made these little missions now in 160 parishes in
  Ireland, and to eleven Irish congregations in England. I
  am, thank God, in as good plight as ever I was in my life
  for this kind of work, and this seems to give a hope that I
  may at length see the effect of it as I wish, or the fruit may
  spring up when I am dead and buried. If death comes
  upon me in this way, I will at least rejoice for myself that
  I am dying more like our Lord than if I finished my course
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">{468}</a></span>
  crowned with the most brilliant successes; for when He
  died people would say He had utterly failed, but He was just
  then achieving His victory. Whatever way things take we
  cannot be disappointed if we keep faithful to God."
</p>
<p>
The lovingness described as subsisting between himself and
his dear Irish people gave rise to many incidents, amongst
which the following is rather peculiar. At one place, where
he had just concluded a little mission, the people gathered
round him when he was about to go away. He heard many
say, "What will we do when he is gone?" and several
other exclamations betokening their affliction at having to
part from him. He turned round and asked all he saw to
accompany him to the railway station. When they arrived
there he addressed them again in something like these
words: "Now, stand here until you see the train start, and
when it is out of sight, I want you all to say, '<i>Thank God,
he is gone</i>.'"
</p>
<p>
He met a great many refusals and cold receptions on these
missionary tours, but in general he was very well received.
The exceptions were dear to him, as they were profitable to
himself, and he seldom spoke of them unless there was some
special lesson they were calculated to convey.
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">{469}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br>
Father Ignatius At Home.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The work of the little missions kept Father Ignatius very
much away from the community. His visits at home were
like meteor flashes, bright and beautiful, and always made
us regret we could not enjoy his edifying company for a
longer time. Those who are much away on the external
duties of the Order find the rule a little severe when they
return; to Father Ignatius it seemed a small heaven of
refreshing satisfaction. His coming home was usually
announced to the community a day or two before, and all were
promising themselves rare treats from his presence amongst
them. It was cheering to see the porter run in, beaming
with joy, as he announced the glad tidings, "Father Ignatius
is come." The exuberance of his own delight as he greeted,
first one, and then another of his companions, added to our
own joy. In fact, the day Father Ignatius came home
almost became a holiday by custom. Those days were; and
we feel inclined to tire our readers by expatiating on them,
as if writing brought them back.
</p>
<p>
Whenever he arrived at one of our houses, and had a day
or two to stay, it was usual for the younger religious, such
as novices and students, to go to him, one by one, for
conference. He liked this very much, and would write to higher
Superiors for permission to turn off to Broadway, for
instance, on his way to London, in order to make acquaintance
with the young religious. His counsels had often a lasting
effect; many who were inclined to leave the life they had
chosen remained steadfast, after a conference with him. He
did not give common-place solutions to difficulties, but he
had some peculiar phrase, some quaint axiom, some droll
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">{470}</a></span>
piece of spirituality, to apply to every little trouble that
came before him. He was specially happy in his fund
of anecdote, and could tell one, it was believed, on any subject
that came before him. This extraordinary gift of
conversational power made the <i>Conferences</i> delightful. The
novices, when they assembled in recreation, and gave their
opinions on Father Ignatius, whom many had spoken to for
the first time in their life, nearly all would conclude, "If
there ever was a saint, he's one."
</p>
<p>
It was amusing to observe how they prepared themselves
for forming their opinion. They all heard of his being a
great saint, and some fancied he would eat nothing at all for
one day, and might attempt a little vegetables on the next.
One novice, in particular, had made up his mind to this, and,
to his great surprise, he saw Father Ignatius eat an extra
good breakfast; and, when about to settle into a rash judgment,
he saw the old man preparing to walk seven miles to
a railway station on the strength of his meal. Another
novice thought such a saint would never laugh nor make
anybody else laugh; to his agreeable disappointment, he
found that Father Ignatius brought more cheerfulness into
the recreation than had been there for some time.
</p>
<p>
In one thing Father Ignatius did not go against anticipation;
he was most exact in the observance of our rules. He
would be always the first in for the midnight office. Many
a time the younger portion of the community used to make
arrangements overnight to be in before him, but it was no
use. Once, indeed, a student arrived in choir before him,
and Father Ignatius appeared so crestfallen at being beaten
that the student would never be in before him again, and
might delay on the way if he thought Father Ignatius had
not yet passed. He seemed particularly happy when he
could light the lamps or gas for matins. He was childlike
in his obedience. He would not transgress the most trifling
regulation. It was usual with him to say, "I cannot understand
persons who say, 'Oh, I am all right if I get to Purgatory.'
We should be more generous with Almighty God.
I don't intend to go to Purgatory, and if I do, I must know
what for." "But, Father Ignatius," a father would say,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">{471}</a></span>
"we fall into so many imperfections that it seems presumption
to attempt to escape scot free." "Well," he would
reply, "nothing can send us to Purgatory but a wilful
venial sin, and may the Lord preserve us from such a thing
as that; a religious ought to die before being guilty of the
least wilful fault." We saw from this that he could scarcely
imagine how a religious could do so, or, at least, that he was
very far from the like himself.
</p>
<p>
One time we were speaking about the Italian way of
pronouncing Latin, which we have adopted; he noticed some
imperfections, and one of the Italian Fathers present
remarked a few points in which Father Ignatius himself failed.
One of them was, that he did not pronounce the letter <i>r</i>
strong enough; and another, that he did not give a its full
sound when it came in the middle of a word. For some time
it was observed that he made a most burring sound when he
pronounced an <i>r</i>, and went so far in correcting himself in
the other particular as to sin against prosody. Sometimes
he would forget little rubrics, but if any one told him of a
mistake, he was scarcely ever seen to commit it again.
</p>
<p>
Whenever he had half an hour to spare he wrote letters.
We may form an idea of his achievements in this point,
when he tells us in the Journal that on two days which
remained free to him once he wrote seventy-eight. A great
number of his letters are preserved. They are very entertaining
and instructive; a nice vein of humour runs through
all those he wrote to his familiar friends.
</p>
<p>
These two letters may be looked upon as the extremes of
the sober and humorous style in his letter-writing:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "When I used to call on you, you seemed to be tottering,
  as one might say, on your last legs. Here you are, after so
  many years, without having ever seen health or prosperity,
  and with about as much life in you as then, to all appearance.
  All has been, all is, and all will be, exactly as it pleases
  God. This is the truth, the grand truth, I would almost
  say the whole and only truth. There may be, and are,
  plenty of things besides, which may be truly affirmed, yet
  this is the whole of what it concerns us each to know. For
  if this is once well understood, of course it follows that we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">{472}</a></span>
  have but one affair to attend to, that is, to please God;
  because then, to a certainty, all the past, present, and future
  will be found to be perfectly and absolutely ordered for our
  own greatest good. If this one point be well studied, I
  think we can steer people easily enough out of all low spirits
  and melancholy. Many people can see the hand of God
  over them in wonderful mercy in their past history, and so
  be brought to a knowledge that their anxieties, and afflictions,
  and groans, in those bygone days were unreasonable
  then. "Why do they not learn to leave off groaning over
  the present troubles? Because they do not trust God to
  manage anything right till they have examined His work,
  and understood all about it. But He, will be more honoured
  if we agree with Him, and approve of what He does before
  we see what the good is which is to come of it. In your
  case, if we go back to the days when I first saw you at &mdash;&mdash;,
  when your father was in a good way of work, and you were
  in health, there was the prospect then, I suppose, before you
  of getting well settled in the world; and if all had continued
  smooth and prosperous, you might now be a rich merchant's
  wife in Birmingham, London, or New York, reckoned the
  ornament of a large circle of wealthy friends, &amp;c. But
  might there not, perhaps, have been written over you as
  your motto? <i>Wo to you rich, for you have received your
  consolation. Wo to you that laugh now for you shall mourn
  and weep</i>. You may be disposed to answer, you do not
  think you would have been spoiled by prosperity. But if you
  are more or less troubled or anxious at being in poverty,
  sickness, or adversity, it shows that you would be, just in
  the same measure, unable to bear prosperity and health
  unhurt. Wealth and prosperity are dangerous to those only
  who love them and trust in them. If, when you are in
  adversity, you are sorry for it, and wish for prosperity, it
  shows love for this world's goods, more or less. And if a
  person loves them when he has them not, is it likely he would
  despise them if he had them? God saves multitudes by
  poverty and afflictions in spite of themselves. The same
  poverty and afflictions, if the persons corresponded with
  God's providence and rejoiced in them, would make them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">{473}</a></span>
  first-rate saints. The same may be said, with as great truth,
  of interior afflictions, scruples, temptations, darkness,
  dryness, and the rest of the catalogue of such miseries. A
  person who is disquieted and anxious on account of these,
  either does not understand that God's gifts are not God, or
  if they do understand it, they love the gifts of God
  independently of the giver. And so I add that such a one, if
  he enjoyed uninterrupted peace and serenity of soul, would
  stop very short indeed of the perfection of love to which
  God intends to lead him if he will be docile. Now, as to
  your case, if you are still alive and still serving God, and
  desiring to do so better and better, it is clear that your
  afflictions, exterior and interior, have not spoiled or ruined
  you. And as God loves our peace and happiness, we may
  conclude that he would not have kept you down and low, if
  it had not been necessary for your good. What have you
  to do at last? Begin again to thank, praise, bless, adore,
  and glorify God for all the tribulations, past and future, and
  he may yet strengthen and preserve you to do abundance of
  good, and lay up a great treasure in heaven."
</p>
<p>
The next letter is to a nun about a book which was
supposed to be lost:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "The second perpetual calendar has been found. I had
  no thought it would; but took my chance to ask, and somebody
  had seen it, and it was looked for again and found. It
  has been a clumsy bit of business on our part; but it ends
  right. It gives another example of the wisdom of a certain
  young shepherdess celebrated in the nursery in my early
  days&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
         "'Little Bopeep
           Has lost her sheep,
      And doesn't know where to find them.
           Let them alone,
           And they'll come home,
      And bring their tails behind them.'
</pre>
<p class="cite">
  "There is great philosophy in the advice given to the
  heroine of these lines.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It seems by what you said the other day, that you
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">{474}</a></span>
  expected a long tail to this sheep, but I don't think the tail
  ever grew. Any way, it never brought a tail so far as this
  house. However, if there does exist a tail to it, I recommend
  to you the calm philosophy of little Bo-peep, and it
  will, I dare say, follow in time."
</p>
<p>
The little rhyme given above was a favourite with Father
Ignatius. When he saw any one looking for a thing with
anxiety he generally rhymed it out with peculiar emphasis.
It might be safely said that he never wrote a letter, preached
a sermon, or held a conversation without introducing
resignation to the will of God, the desire of perfection, or the
conversion of England.
</p>
<p>
As he was always a Superior, the religious could come to
him and speak whenever they pleased. He was ever ready
to receive them, he laid down his pen, or whatever else he
might be at, directly he saw a brother or father wished
to speak to him, and he listened and spoke as if this
conversation was the only duty he had to discharge.
</p>
<p>
In recreation he was a treasure. We gathered round him
by a kind of instinct, and so entertaining was he that one felt
it a mortification to be called away from the recreation-room
while Father Ignatius was in it. He used to recount with
peculiar grace and fascinating wit, scenes he went through
in his life. There is scarcely an incident in this volume that
we have not heard him relate. He was most ingenuous.
Ask him what question you pleased, he would answer it,
if he knew it. In relating an anecdote he often spoke in five
or six different tones of voice; he imitated the manner and
action of those he knew to such perfection, that laughter
had to pass into admiration. He seldom laughed outright,
and even when he did, he would very soon stop. If he came
across a number of <i>Punch</i>, he ran over some of the sketches
at once and then he would be observed to stop, laugh, and
lay it down directly, as if to deny himself further enjoyment.
It is needless to say there was nothing rollicking, or
off-handed in his wit&mdash;never; it was subdued, sweet, delicate,
and lively. He would introduce very often amusing puzzles,
such as passing the poker around, or the game of "He can
do little who cannot do that, that, that." Then to see his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">{475}</a></span>
glee when some one thought he had found out the secret by
his keenness of observation, and was far from it; and how
he laughed at the <i>denouement</i> of the mystery, when all
was over, was really delightful. He often made us try
"Theophilus Thistlethwick," and "Peter Piper," and used
to enjoy the blunders immensely. In fact, a recreation,
presided over by Father Ignatius, was the most innocent
and gladsome one could imagine.
</p>
<p>
He had a few seasons of illness in the closing years of his
life; in 1861 he was laid up for several days with a sore
foot, in Highgate. When one of us is ill, it is customary
for the members of the house to take turn about in staying
with him, and we are allowed to go at all times to visit an
invalid. Whenever Father Ignatius was asked how his foot
was, he would say it was "very well," because it brought
him some pain, and that was a valuable thing if we only
knew how to turn it to good account. He felt very grateful
for the smallest service done him in sickness. It is supposed
that he wrote more letters during his illness, and held
more "profitable" conversations than in any other equal
period of his life. No one ever found him idle. He read,
or he wrote, or he talked, or he prayed, or he slept. Lying
awake and listless in bed, even when suffering from acute
pain, seemed an imperfection to him. Complaint was like
a language he had forgotten, or knew not, except as one
knows sin by the contrary virtue.
</p>
<p>
He suffered greatly from drowsiness. When he went to
meditation he would nod asleep, and the exertions he made
to keep himself awake made us pity him. He would stand
up, even sometimes on one foot, extend his arms in the form
of a cross, and do everything he could possibly think of in
order to keep awake. During his rectorship in Button, after
returning from a sick call on a cold winter's evening, he
was obliged to walk about saying his office. He dared not
sit down, or he would go off asleep, and had to avoid going
near a fire, or no effort could keep him awake. Notwithstanding
this, he was the first to matins, and seldom went
to bed again before prime. When others were ill, Father
Ignatius was all charity; he would make sure first that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">{476}</a></span>
they took their sickness in a right spirit, and thanked God
for it, then he would see that all kinds of attention were
paid to them. As for sick calls, no matter at what hour of
the day or night they came, he would be the first to go out
and attend them. He liked assisting at death-beds; he
felt particular pleasure in helping people to heaven.
</p>
<p>
He received all kinds of visitors. He went immediately
to see any one that wanted to speak to him, and never kept
them a moment waiting if he could possibly help it. When
distinguished visitors were coming he did not make the
least preparation, but just treated them like any one else.
His sister promised to visit him in Highgate in December,
1859. Neither she nor any member of his family had ever
been in one of our monasteries; he therefore looked upon
this as a kind of event. Father Ignatius had a wretched
old mantle, and one of the students went to him to offer him
his, which was quite new, for the day. He would not at all
accept of it, and lectured the other upon human respect for
his pains.
</p>
<p>
He was very fond of conducting the walk the students
take every week. He brought the London students often
through the City, and wonderful was his knowledge and
reminiscences of the different places they passed by. He
took them once to the Zoological Gardens. They went about
looking at the different beasts, and he had his comments to
make on each. He drew a moral reflection from the voraciousness
of the lion, the fierceness of the hyaena, the vanity of the
seal, and the stupor of the sloth. When he saw the flamingo,
he stayed full ten minutes wondering what might be the use
of its long, thin legs. The hippopotamus amused him beyond
all. "Look at his big mouth," he would say; "what in the
world does he want it for? Couldn't he eat enough with a
smaller one?" During their walks, a lord, perhaps, would
turn up, and address him as, "Ho, Spencer! is this you?
How d'ye do? It is some years since I saw you?" After
a few words they would part, and then he'd tell his
companions about their college days, or field sports.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
A Few Events.</h2>
<br>
<p>
In 1858 we procured the place in Highgate, known now as
St. Joseph's Retreat. The Hyde was never satisfactory; it
was suited neither to our spirit nor its working. At last
Providence guided us to a most suitable position. Our rule
prescribes that the houses of the Order should be outside the
town, and near enough to be of service to it. Highgate is
wonderfully adapted to all the requisitions of our rule and
constitutions. Situated on the brow of a hill, it is far enough
from the din and noise of London to be comparatively free
from its turmoil, and sufficiently near for citizens to come to
our church. The grounds are enclosed by trees; a hospital
at one end and two roads meeting at the other, promise a
freedom from intrusion and a continuance of the solitude we
now enjoy. Father Ignatius concludes the year 1858 in
Highgate; it was his first visit to the new house.
</p>
<p>
Towards the end of the next year we find him once more
in France with our Provincial. They went on business
interesting to the Order, and were nearly three weeks away.
Father Ignatius ends another year in Highgate. It was
then he translated the small "Life of Blessed Paul" from
the Italian, a work he accomplished in about one month
with the assistance of an <i>amanuensis</i>.
</p>
<p>
He gave a mission with three of the fathers in Westland
Row, Dublin, in the beginning of the year 1860, and started
off immediately after for his circuit of little missions. Our
Provincial Chapter was held this year, but all were
re-elected; so Father Ignatius remained as he was, second
Consultor. It was this year he visited Althorp, after an absence
of eighteen years from the home of his childhood. This visit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">{478}</a></span>
he looked back to with a great deal of satisfaction, and his joy
was increased when Lord and Lady Sarah Spencer returned
his visit in Highgate, when he happened to be there, the
next year. The friendly relations between him and his
family seemed, if possible, to become closer and more
cordial towards the end of his life.
</p>
<p>
He told us one day in recreation, when some one asked
what became of the lady he was disposed to be married to,
once in his life: "I passed by her house a few days ago. I
believe her husband is a very excellent man, and that she is
happy."
</p>
<p>
In 1862 he visited Althorp again. We saw him looking
for a lock for one of his bags before he left Highgate for
this visit, and some one asked him why he was so particular
just then. "Oh," he said, "don't you know the servant in
the big house will open it, in order to put my shaving tackle,
brush, and so forth in their proper places, and I should not
like to have a general stare at my habit, beads, and sandals."
There was, however, a more general stare at them than he
expected. During the visit, the volunteer corps were entertained
by Lord Spencer. Father Ignatius was invited to the
grand dinner; he sat next the Earl, and nothing would do for
the latter but that his uncle should make a speech. Father
Ignatius stood up in <i>his</i> regimentals, habit, sandals, &amp;c., and
made, it seems, a very patriotic one.
</p>
<p>
This visit to Althorp Father Ignatius loved to recall to
mind. It was a kind of thing that he could not enjoy at
the time, so far did it go beyond his expectations. He went
merely for a friendly visit, and found a great many old
friends invited to increase his pleasure. When the ladies
and gentlemen went off to dress for dinner, it is said that
Father Ignatius told Lady Spencer that he supposed his full
dress would not be quite in place at the table; he was told
it would, and that all would be much delighted to see a
specimen of the fashions he had learnt since his days of
whist and repartee in the same hall. At the appointed time
he presented himself in the dining-room in full Passionist
costume. Lord Spencer was quite proud of his uncle, and
the speech, and the cheer with which it was greeted at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">{479}</a></span>
Volunteers' dinner only enhanced the mutual joy of uncle
and nephew.
</p>
<p>
As usual, this joy was tempered, and the alloy was
administered by a clergyman, who evidently intended to get
himself a name by putting himself into print in one of the
local papers. This was a Mr. Watkins. He wrote a letter
to the <i>Northampton Herald</i>, containing a great deal of
shallow criticism and ignorant remarks on Father Ignatius,
and a sermon he preached at the opening of the cathedral.
A smart paper warfare was carried on for some time between
the two, which earned the Rev. Mr. Watkins the disapproval,
if not the disgust, of his Protestant clerical and lay
neighbours. This was rather a surprise, as all the old
acquaintances of the <i>quondam</i> Mr. Spencer had the highest
regard for him; but this writer seems to have been one who
never had the opportunity of forming a just opinion of his
abilities or character. Ignorance may excuse his blunders,
but the longest stretch of charity can scarcely overlook his
manner of committing them.
</p>
<p>
After the visit to Althorp, Father Ignatius went to see
Mr. De Lisle at Grace Dieu, and was present at the blessing
of the present Abbot of Mount St. Bernard's. The secretary
of the A. P. U. C. sent him another letter after this visit,
which met the fate of similar communications on former
occasions.
</p>
<p>
We find him in the beginning of the year 1863 in Liverpool,
engaged in a mission at St. Augustine's.
</p>
<p>
After this mission he came to Highgate, on his way to
Rome for our general chapter, and the few days he had on
his hands before his departure were spent in visiting Lord
Palmerston, Mr. Gladstone, and other notabilities, as well
as receiving a visit from his nephew.
</p>
<p>
He arrived in Rome for the last time on the 22nd April,
1863. How strangely do his different visits to this city
combine to give an idea of the stages of opinion through
which his chequered life was fated to pass. In 1821, he
entered it, promising himself a feast of absurdities, determined
to sneer at what he did not understand, and repel by
his thick shield of prejudice whatever might force itself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">{480}</a></span>
upon him as praiseworthy. He found something in his next
visit in the pagan remains to please his Protestant taste, and
left it for Germany with a kind of regret. In less than ten
years he is there to despise the glory of the Caesars, and
thinks more of a chapel which Peter's successor has endowed
or adorned, than the platforms on which the fangs of the
leopard tore the flower of our martyrs. His other visits
were mostly official. He came glowing with the fervour of
new projects, and left with only their embers generating a
new step in his spiritual progress. Rome was always Rome,
but he was not always the same. Any one who takes the
trouble to compare his different visits with each other cannot
fail to learn a lesson that will be more telling on his
mind, than what comments upon them by another's pen
could produce.
</p>
<p>
The General Chapter Father Ignatius was called to attend
in 1863 had to deal with subjects that deeply concerned
the interests of our Order. In this Chapter, our American
province was canonically erected in the United States. A
colony of ten Passionists was sent to California, and the
Hospice of St. Nicholas, in Paris, established. Father
Ignatius had, as usual, some papers to submit to the Roman
Curia. The work to which his "little missions" were devoted
had not yet received the seal of the Fisherman, and,
until it was so blessed, its excellence could be a subject of
doubt. He did receive the pontifical benediction for this,
and for the institution of a new congregation of nuns, and
began to enjoy the riches of this twofold blessing before he
took his departure from the Eternal City.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius, ever himself, did not lose sight of lesser
claims on his gratitude in the greater ones his zeal proposed
to him. There was a family whom he had received into the
Church during the course of his labours on the secular
mission. The father, and four daughters, and a son, were
all baptized by him. They were his great joy. He first
received one girl, then the father, then another (who dreaded
to speak to him), a third, and a fourth yielded to his charity
and meekness in following the workings of grace. For them
he always entertained a special regard, he would stay with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">{481}</a></span>
them when missionary work called him to a town in which
they dwelled, and delighted to caress their children, edify
themselves, and make himself at home in their dwellings
during his stay. He obtained a rescript granting them a
"plenary indulgence," signed by the Holy Father himself,
which is still treasured up as a beautiful heirloom in their
families. These favoured objects of his predilection were
Mrs. Macky, of Birmingham; Mrs. Richardson and Mrs.
Marshall, of Levenshulme, Manchester.
</p>
<p>
Before leaving Rome in 1863 he preached to nuns and
schools, upon the conversion of England, with the same
zeal as he did in 1850, if not with greater. That leading
star lived with him; it is to be hoped it has not died with
him. If the nineteenth century were an age of faith, and
that the belief in God's miraculous interposition would
move any to make experiments of holy wonders, we should
expect to find engraved on his heart after death: "The
Conversion of England!"
</p>
<p>
On June 21, after exactly two months' stay, he left the
terrestrial Rome, or city of God, for ever. He arrives in
London on the 3rd August, visits convents for his "crusade,"
now doubly dear to him; communicates his glad tidings to
the infant congregations of nuns of Sutton, and holds himself
in readiness for the approaching provincial chapter.
The nuns here mentioned are a society established, a few
years before, by our Father Gaudentius. Their primary
object is the care and instruction of factory girls, their
subsidiary one, the plain instruction of poor children.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius loved this institute. One of his common
sayings was, "I do not understand how a girl with a wooden
leg, no means and great docility, cannot make the evangelical
vows," and he found himself at home with a sisterhood where
his problem would be solved in part at least. He brought
their rules to Rome, at this time, and received all the
Pontifical sanctions he could possibly expect under the
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
On August 21 of this year, our Provincial Chapter was
held at Broadway. Here Father Ignatius was elected
Rector of St. Anne's Retreat, Sutton. He entered on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">{482}</a></span>
office with a great deal of zeal and courage. In his first
exhortation to the religious, he remarked that "new brooms
sweep clean," but as he was a broom a little the worse for
wear, which had been trimmed up for action after having so
long lain by, the aphorism could not apply so well to him.
It was nine years since he had filled the office of rector
before, and the interval taught him many things regarding
religious discipline which he now brought into action.
</p>
<p>
His rule might be called <i>maternal</i> rather than paternal,
for it was characterized by the fondness of holy old age for
youth. One change remarked in him, since his former
rectorship, was, his spicing his gentle admonitions with a
good deal of severity when occasion required it. He spoke
to the community, after the evening recreation, once upon the
conversion of England, and the bright look the horizon of
religious opinion wore now in comparison to the time he first
began his crusade. He hoped great things for England.
At this part of his lecture, some ludicrous occurrence, which
he did not observe, made one of the younger religious laugh.
Father Ignatius turned upon him, and spoke with such
vehemence that all seemed as if struck by a thunderbolt.
They never heard him speak in that way before, and it was
thought by many that the meek father could not "foam with
indignation," even if he tried.
</p>
<p>
Towards the close of 1863 he professed several of the
nuns of the Holy Family, for whom he had procured the
indulgences at Rome, and he assisted at the deathbed of their
first rev. mother early in 1864.
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">{483}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br>
Trials And Crosses.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The days of the religious life of Father Ignatius might be
numbered by his trials and crosses. It was not that a goodly
share fell to him, as became his great holiness; but he
happened to be so very keenly tried, that what generally
assuages the bitterness of ordinary trials served, by a special
disposition of Providence, to make his the more galling.
His trials were multiplied in their infliction; the friends to
whom he might unburthen himself were often their unconscious
cause; and the remedies proposed for his comfort
would be generally an aggravation of his sufferings. He
had an abiding notion of his being alone and abandoned,
which followed him like a shadow, even unto the grave.
This feeling arose from his spirit of zeal. He burned to be
doing more and more for God's glory every day, and sought
to communicate to others some sparks of the flames that
consumed himself. His projects for carrying out his ideas
seldom met the cordial approval of superiors, and when he
received such sanction, it was only after his schemes had
been considerably toned down. This restraint he had always
to bear.
</p>
<p>
When his plans were tolerated, or even approved, he
could not find one to take them up as warmly as he wished.
In fact, he found no second. Catholics have an instinctive
aversion to anything that wears the appearance of novelty
in their devotions. Father Ignatius's plans for the sanctification
of Ireland, the conversion of England, and the perfection
all should tend to, were very good things. No one
could have the least objection to them; but, somehow, every
one could not see his way to working them out. When
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">{484}</a></span>
Father Ignatius proposed the means he intended to adopt,
the old Catholic shrugged his shoulders as if he had heard a
temerarious proposition. It was new; the good old bishop
that gave his life for his flock, or the saintly priest he had
listened to from childhood, never proposed such a thing.
He never read it in his books of piety, and though it seemed
very good, it "did not go down with him." He listened to
the holy Passionist, because he reverenced him; but he
never encouraged his zeal with more than a cold assent.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius found this want of correspondence to his
suggestions in every person even his own brethren in religion
failed to be of accord with him. He was perpetually
speaking upon his favourite topics, and never seemed satisfied
with the work of his fellow-labourers if they did not
take up his ideas. He often drew down upon himself severe
animadversions on account of this state of mind. When
fathers returned to the retreat, tired and wearied after a
number of missions, they felt it rather hard to be told that
they had done very little, because they had not set about
their work in his way. He would be told very sharply that
they should wish to see what he had done himself; that his
chimerical notions looked well on paper, or sounded nicely
in talk; that there was a surer way of guiding people to
heaven than talking them into fancies beyond their comprehension.
These remarks only served to bring out the virtue
and humility of the saintly man. He became silent at once,
or turned the conversation into another channel.
</p>
<p>
He had a still severer trial in this point. He very
frequently attributed the caution of his superiors to want of
zeal, and used to lecture them without human respect on
what he thought to be their duty. On one occasion he went
so far as to complain of this to Cardinal Wiseman; but the
explanation was so satisfactory that he gave expression to
different sentiments for the future. Whenever they spoke
positively, he immediately acquiesced, and was most exact
in carrying out their injunctions. His zeal was unbounded,
and one of his superiors always said: "Father Ignatius will
become a saint by the very thwarting of his plans." If he
had not the virtue of submitting his judgment, it is hard to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">{485}</a></span>
say into what extravagances he might rush. This one trial
was the staple of his religious life for more than thirty
years.
</p>
<p>
We shall now give a few instances from his letters, and
from anecdotes recorded of him, to show the spirit with
which he bore this and kindred trials and crosses.
</p>
<p>
In 1853 he received a very severe letter from one of our
Belgian fathers, who is in high repute for learning and
virtue. He forwarded the letter to Father Eugene, who
was then Provincial, accompanied by these remarks:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I thought of answering the enclosed letter from Father
  &mdash;&mdash; at once, before sending it to your Paternity; but, on
  looking it over again, I have changed my mind. The rule
  which I make for myself is, to mind what my superiors say
  on this matter and the conversion of England, and to charge
  them to stop my proceedings if they disapprove of them. I
  shall take what they say as coming from God, who has a
  right to dispose of all souls, and who may judge that the
  time for grace in England is not come, or never has to
  come. Besides, they are the proper judges whether my
  proceedings are correct <i>in toto</i> or in part. Your Paternity
  has lately expressed your mind upon the matter, and I have
  no scruple on the subject; but it is well you should know
  what others feel. I beg you to take this letter from Father
  &mdash;&mdash; as kindly meant, and, with me, to be thankful for it."
</p>
<p>
Another to his Provincial:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "With regard to the principal topic of your Paternity's
  letter, I will first thank you, and thank God that I am
  thought worthy to be spoken and written to, without
  dissimulation or reserve, of what people think of me. If I
  make use with diligence of their remarks, I shall be able to
  gain ground in the esteem of God, and, perhaps, also in
  men's esteem; but that is not of consequence. Now, I suppose
  it would be best not to have said so much in explanation
  of my intentions in time past; and certainly I have
  said things which were vexing in the course of these explanations.
  It is no justification of this to allege that your
  Paternity's style of writing admonitions and reproofs is more
  severe than that of some persons, because I ought to receive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">{486}</a></span>
  all with joy. But the cutting tone of some of your letters
  excites me to answer more or less in a cutting tone on my
  side, and I have given way to this temptation. It appears
  to me, it would be better if with me and others your tone
  was not so cutting. But God so appoints it for us, and so I
  had better prefer his judgment to my own, and persevere
  correcting myself, till I can answer cutting letters with the
  same gentle, affectionate language as I might the mildest
  ones. In this way I shall be the greatest gainer. So I will
  conclude with leaving it to your Paternity to decide in what
  tone you will correct me&mdash;only begging that you will not
  omit the correction when you see me in the wrong, and that
  you will inflict it, for charity's sake, at the risk even of
  suffering pain from my hasty and improper answers, which I
  cannot expect to correct at once, though I will try to do it.
  Will you let me meet you at the station when you pass
  through London, and accompany you to the station for the
  Dover Railway?"
</p>
<p>
In another letter, he writes:&mdash;

  "I am frequently assailed with black doubts about the

  go on again with brighter spirits than ever, and, in the end,
  I am astonished how Providence has carried me clear of

</p>
<p>
As may be seen from some of the letters introduced
above, Father Ignatius had to endure trials from the want
of sympathy with his ways, in many of the English converts.
One celebrated convert went so far as to prohibit
his speaking of the conversion of England to any of the
members of a community of which he was Superior.
Another used to tell him that "England was already
damned," and that it was no use praying for it. A third
treated him to some sharp cuts about the work of his little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">{487}</a></span>
missions, when answering an application of Father Ignatius
to give one in his parish. These and many other crosses of
the like nature, he used to complain of with deep feeling
among his fellow religious. It is remarkable that those
who crossed him had great respect for his holiness, and,
very likely, their opposition proceeded from not giving him
credit for much prudence.
</p>
<p>
An incident that happened to him in one of his journeys
in Ireland will give an idea of how he bore humiliations.
He was walking to one of the principal towns in Tipperary,
and a vehicle overtook him on the road. The man in the
car took compassion on the poor old priest, and asked him
to "take a lift." Father Ignatius took his seat at once;
before they had proceeded far together, his companion perceived
that he spoke in an "English accent," and began to
doubt his being a priest. There had been some ugly rows
in the town, lately, on account of a gang of "soupers" that
infested it, and it struck the good townsman that his waggon
was carrying a veritable "souper. "What," thought he, "if
the neighbours should see me carrying such a precious cargo?"
And, without asking or waiting for an explanation, he
unceremoniously told Father Ignatius "to get down, for he
suspected he wasn't of the right sort." Father Ignatius
complied at once, without the least murmur. When the
man was about a mile ahead of his late fellow-traveller, and
could not stifle the remorse occasioned by his hasty leave-taking,
he resolved to turn back and catechise him. The
result satisfied him, and the good father was invited to take
a seat a second time. To atone for his almost unpardonable
crime, as he thought it, the man invited him to stay at his
house for the night, as it was then late. Father Ignatius
said he was due at the priest's house, but in case he found
nobody up there, he should be happy to avail himself of his
friend's hospitality. They parted company in the town;
Father Ignatius went to the priest's, and the other to his
home. They were all in bed in the presbytery, and no
answer was returned to the repeated knocks and rings of the
benighted traveller. He went to the friend's house, but
found <i>they</i>, too, were gone to bed. No word was left about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">{488}</a></span>
Father Ignatius, and his strange accent made the housewife
refuse him admittance. He went off without saying a
word in explanation. The man bethought himself shortly
after, and sent messengers to seek him, who overtook him
outside the town, walking off to the next, which he
expected to reach before morning.
</p>
<p>
Another time he undertook the foundation of a convent
in Staffordshire. With his usual indifference in matters
temporal, he made no material provision whatever for the
reception of the sisters, except a bleak, unfurnished house.
The reverend mother came, with three or four sisters, and
was rather disconcerted at what she found before them.
Father Ignatius was expected in a day or two, and as the
time of his arrival approached, the reverend mother went
into the reception-room, and there sate&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
       "A sullen dame,
     "Nursing her wrath to keep it warm."
</pre>
<p>
Father Ignatius got a very hot reception. The lady scolded
him heartily for his carelessness, and descanted most
eloquently on the wants and grievances she had to endure since
her arrival. He replied calmly that it was not his fault,
that that department of the proceedings devolved on the
parish priest. This only fired her the more&mdash;"Why didn't
he tell the parish priest?" He then waited, quietly standing
until she had exhausted her stock of abuse; whereupon
he asked if she had done, and on receiving a nod in
the affirmative, he said: "Oh, well, I know how I must
approach your ladyship in future, I must make three bows
in the Turkish fashion." So saying, he bowed nearly to
the ground, retreated a step and bowed again, a third step
backwards brought him to the door of the apartment, and
when he had bowed still deeper than before, he stood up
straight, took out a purse with some sovereigns in it, and
spun it to the corner of the room in which the good nun
sat petrified with astonishment:&mdash;"Take that now, and it
may calm you a bit," was the good morning he bid her, as
he closed the door after him, and went his way.
</p>
<p>
The tongue of slander assailed him again the last year of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">{489}</a></span>
his life. We will give the occurrence in the words of the
only one to whom the reverend mother told it in confidence.
Father Ignatius himself never spoke of it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "As our dear Lord loved him much, he wished to try
  him as he had tried the dearest and best-beloved of his
  servants. Therefore he permitted that his character should be
  assailed in the most vile manner by one who, through mistaken
  zeal, gave out the most injurious insinuations regarding
  our dear father and the late reverend mother. When
  Father Ignatius heard of it, he sent for the reverend mother
  to exhort her to bear the calumny with love and resignation.
  In speaking to her he said that God had asked all
  of him, and he had freely given all but his good name, and
  that he was ready now to offer as it had pleased God to ask
  for it; for all belonged to Him and he thanked Him for
  leaving him nothing. 'Will you not.' he continued, 'do
  the same? Do you not see that God is asking you for the
  dearest thing you can give? Give it, then, freely, and
  thank Him for taking it, for don't you see that by this you
  are resembling Him more closely? Besides, He has permitted
  this to happen, and if we do not give up our good
  name, which already belongs to Him, cheerfully and willingly,
  He will take it, in spite of us, and we shall lose the
  merit of our offering. How foolish, therefore, is it to go
  against God! Let us resign ourselves unreservedly into his
  hands. However, to remove any scandal that might follow,
  and to show this good priest that I have no ill-feeling
  against him, I will go and visit him on friendly terms.'
  And so he did."
</p>
<p>
Besides casual attacks of illness brought on by his want
of care or great labours, he suffered during the latter part
of his life from chronic ailments. His heart often troubled
him, and medical men told him that he would very likely
die of disease of the heart. He had an ulcer in one of his
ancles for a number of years, and was often obliged to keep
his bed on account of it. No one ever heard him complain,
and yet his sufferings must have been very acute. We
never remarked him rejoice so much over this painful sore,
than when one of the fathers, who respected him much, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">{490}</a></span>
wanted to test his mortification, became a Job's comforter.
He said: "You deserve to be lame, Father Ignatius, you
made such use of your feet in the days of your dancing and
sporting, that Almighty God is punishing you now, and the
instruments of your pleasure are aptly turned into instruments
of pain." He said it was quite true, and that he
believed so himself, and that his only wish was that he
might not lose a particle of the merit it would bring him,
by any kind of complaint on his part. He got a rupture in
1863, and he simply remarked, "I have made another step
down the hill to-day."
</p>
<p>
Whilst labouring under a complication of sufferings he
never abated one jot of his round of duties, though requested
to do so by his subjects. He was Superior, and exercised
his privilege by doing more than any other instead of
sparing himself. He did not take more rest nor divide his
labours with his companions. During the time of his
rectorship in Sutton, he used to preach and sing mass after
hearing confessions all morning; attend sick calls, preach in
some distant chapel in the evening, return at eleven o'clock,
perhaps, and say his office, and be the first up to matins at
two o'clock again. The only thing that seemed to pain
him was a kind of holy envy. He used to say to the young
priests: "Oh, how well it is for you that are young and
buoyant, I am now stiff and old, and must have but a short
time to labour for Almighty God; still I hope to be able to
work to the last." This was his ordinary discourse the
very year he died, and the young fathers were much struck
by the coincidence between his wishes and their completion.
</p>
<p>
Father Ignatius Paoli, the Provincial, gave the cook
orders to take special care of the indefatigable worn-out
Rector. He was not to heed the fasts of the Rule, or at
least to give the Superior the full supply of meagre diet.
Father Ignatius took the indulgence thankfully for two or
three days after returning from a mission; but when he
saw a better portion served up for himself oftener than was
customary for the other missionaries, he remonstrated with
the brother cook. Next day he was served in the same
manner, he then gave a prohibition, and at last scolded him.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">{491}</a></span>
The good brother then told him that he was only carrying
out the Provincial's orders. Father Ignatius was silent,
but, after dinner, posted off to the doctor, and made him
give a certificate of good health and ability to fast, which he
forwarded to the Provincial. Father Provincial did not
wish to deny him the opportunity of acquiring greater
merit, and, at the same time, he would prolong so valuable
a life. To save both ends he placed him under the obedience,
as far as regarded his health, of one of the priests of
his community, whom he strictly obeyed in this matter
thenceforward.
</p>
<p>
Once he went on a sick-call in very wet weather, and
either a cramp or an accident made him fall into a dirty
slough, where he was wetted through and covered with mud.
He came home in this state, and finding a friend of his at
the house, who more or less fell into his way of thinking,
he began to converse with him. The good father began to
speak of the conversion of England, and sat in his wet
clothes for a couple of hours, and likely would have stayed
longer, so thoroughly was he engrossed with his favourite
topic, if one of the religious had not come in, and frightened
him off to change garments by his surprise and apprehension.
</p>
<p>
He seemed indifferent to cold; he would sit in his cell,
the coldest day, and write until his fingers became numbed,
and then he would warm them by rubbing his hands together
rather than allow himself the luxury of a fire. He
went to give a retreat somewhere in midwinter, and the
room he had to lodge in was so exposed that the snow came
in under the door. Here he slept, without bed or fire, for
the first night of his stay. It was the thoughtlessness of
his entertainers that left him in these cold quarters. In
the morning some one remarked that very probably Father
Ignatius slept in the dreary apartment alluded to. A person
ran down to see, and there was the old saint amusing
himself by gathering up the snow that came into his room,
and making little balls of it for a kitten to run after. The
kitten and himself seem to have become friends by having
slept together in his rug the night before, and both were
disappointed by the intrusion of the wondering visitor.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">{492}</a></span>
<p>
His humility was as remarkable to any one who knew
him as was his zeal; and on this point also he was well
tried. It is not generally known that in the beginning of
his Passionist life he adopted the custom of praying before
his sermons that God's glory would be promoted by them
and himself be humiliated. At the opening of Sutton
Church in 1852, he was sent for from London to preach a
grand sermon in the evening. A little before the sermon
he was walking up and down the corridor; the Provincial
met him and asked more in joke than otherwise: "Well,
Father Ignatius, what are you thinking of now?" "I am
praying," he replied, "that if it be for the glory of God my
sermon may be a complete failure as far as human eloquence
is concerned." We may imagine the surprise of his Superior
at hearing this extraordinary answer; it is believed
that this was his general practice to the end. Contrary to
the common notion that prevails among religious orders, he
wished that the Order would receive humiliations as well as
himself. He wished it to come to glory by its humiliations.
On one occasion, he expected that the newspapers would
make a noise about something that might be interpreted as
humiliating to the community of which he was Superior.
Father Ignatius addressed the community nearly in these
words: We shall have something to thank God for tomorrow;
the Protestants will make a great noise in the
papers about this affair, and we must be prepared for a full
feast of misrepresentations. Let us thank God now in
anticipation." He was disappointed, however, as the papers
were content with a bare notice of the matter.
</p>
<p>
Many persons did not give him credit for great humility;
they thought his continual quoting of himself, and his
readiness to speak about his doings, was, if not egotism, at
least inconsistent with profound humility. We cannot
answer this imputation better than by giving Father Faber's
description of simplicity, which every one knows to be the
very character of genuine humility:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But let us cast an eye at the action of simplicity in the
  spiritual life. Simplicity lives always in a composed
  consciousness of its own demerit and unworthiness. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">{493}</a></span>
  possessed with a constant sense of what the soul is in the
  sight of God. It knows that we are worth no more than
  we are worth in His sight, and while it never takes its eye
  off that view of self, so it does not in any way seek to hide
  it from others. In fact it desires to be this, and no more
  than this, in the eyes of others; and it is pained when it is
  more. Every neighbour is, as it were, one of God's eyes,
  multiplying His presence; and simplicity acts as if every
  one saw us, knew us, and judged us as God does, and it has
  no wounded feeling that it is so. Thus, almost without
  direct effort, the soul of self-love is so narrowed that it has
  comparatively little room for action; although it never can
  be destroyed, nor its annoyance ever cease, except in the
  silence of the grave. The chains of human respect, which
  in the earlier stages of the spiritual life galled us so
  intolerably, now fall off from us, because simplicity has drawn us
  into the unclouded and unsetting light of the eye of God.
  There is no longer any hypocrisy. There is no good opinion
  to lose, because we know we deserve none, and doubt if we
  possess it. We believe we are loved in spite of our faults,
  and respected because of the grace which is in us, and which
  is not our own and no praise to us. All diplomacy is gone,
  for there is no one to circumvent and nothing to appropriate.
  There is no odious laying ourselves out for edification, but
  an inevitable and scarcely conscious letting of our light
  shine before men in such an obviously innocent and unintentional
  manner that it is on that account they glorify our
  Father who is in Heaven."&mdash;<i>Blessed Sacrament</i>, Book II.,
  c. vii.
</p>
<p>
The secret by which Father Ignatius arrived at this
perfect way of receiving trials was his <i>thanking God</i> for
everything. When some one objected to him that we could
not thank God for a trial when we did not feel grateful,
"Never mind," he would say, "you take a hammer to break
a big stone; the first stroke has no effect, the second seemingly
no effect, and the third, and so on; but somewhere
about the twentieth or hundredth the stone is broken, and
no one stroke was heavier than the other. In the same way,
begin to thank God, no matter about the feeling, continue,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">{494}</a></span>
and you will soon break the hardest difficulties." His
maxims and sayings on resignation would fill a good-sized
volume were they collected together. We shall conclude
this chapter with one picked by chance from his letters:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "In trials and crosses we are like a sick child, when its
  mother wants it to take some disagreeable medicine. The
  child kicks and screams and sprawls, and spits the medicine
  in its mother's face. That is just what we do when God
  sends us crosses and trials. But, like the mother, who will
  persevere in giving the medicine until the child has taken
  enough of it, God will send us crosses and trials until we
  have sufficient of them for the health of our souls."
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">{495}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br>
Foreshadowings And Death.</h2>
<br>
<p>
Father Ignatius, for some months before his death, had a
kind of sensation that his dissolution was near. He paid
many <i>last</i> visits to his old friends, and, in arranging by letter
for the greater number of flying visits, he used generally to
say, "I suppose I shall not be able to pay many more."
Writing to Mrs. Hutchinson in Edinburgh from St. Anne's
Retreat, Button, in March, 1864, he says: "When I wrote
to you some months ago in answer to your kind letter, I
think I expressed a hope that I might again have the
pleasure of conversation with you before the closing of our
earthly pilgrimage. It was a distant and uncertain prospect
then. Now it is become a near and likely one, and I write
to express my satisfaction at it." He was heard to say by
many that the volume of his journal he was writing would
last him till the end of his life, and it is a curious circumstance
that the last page of it is just half-written, and comes
up to September 18, less than a fortnight before his death.
</p>
<p>
Our Father-General came from Rome to make the visitation
of this province in May, 1864, and Father Ignatius
acted as interpreter throughout the greater part of the visit.
He was as young as ever in his plans for the conversion of
England, sanctification of Ireland, and advancing all to
perfection; and the approbation of the General to the main
drift of his projects inflamed him with fresh ardour. A
characteristic incident occurred during this visit. The
Father-General was inspecting the books Father Ignatius
was obliged to keep, as Rector of Sutton, and he found
them rather irregular. The entries were neither clear nor
orderly, and it was next to an impossibility to obtain any
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">{496}</a></span>
exact notion of the income and expenditure of the house.
The General called the Rector to his room, in order to
rebuke him for his carelessness. He began to lecture, and
when he had said something rather warm looked at Father
Ignatius, to see what effect it might produce, when, to his
surprise, he found that he had nodded off asleep. He awoke
up in an instant, and complimented the Father-General on
his patience. Such was the indifference he had reached to
by the many and cutting rebukes he had borne through life.
</p>
<p>
In August, 1864, Father Ignatius wrote a long letter to
Father Ignatius Paoli, our Provincial, about his doings, and
he seemed as fresh in them as if he had but just commenced
his crusade. We shall give one extract from this letter:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I could hardly have the spirit to keep up this work (the
  sanctification of Ireland) if it was not for aiming at a result
  so greatly for the glory of God, and working with a resolution
  to conquer. How exceedingly would it add to my
  spirit if I knew that our body was penetrated with the same
  thought, and we thus were supporting each other!"
</p>
<p>
So late as September 8 he had prepared a paper embodying his
intentions, which he intended to submit to Roman authority.
Ever himself to the last.
</p>
<p>
Before leaving the retreat for his "<i>raid</i>" as he called it,
in Scotland, he called all the members of the community,
one by one, to conference; he did the same with a convent of
nuns, of which he had spiritual charge. He gave them all
special advices, which are not forgotten, and his last sermon
to his brethren, a day or two before he left, on the conversion
of England through their own sanctification, was
singularly impressive. It moved many to tears; and, those
who heard him, say it was the most thrilling ever heard from
him on the subject. In talking over some matter of future
importance with his Vicar, before he left for Scotland, he
suddenly stopped short, saying, "Others will see after this,"
or some such words. All those who spoke with him confidentially
recall some dubious half-meaning expressions that
seemed to come from an inward consciousness of his
approaching end.
</p>
<p>
He was remarked to be very sombre and reflective in his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">{497}</a></span>
last missions, but now and then his usual pleasant mood
would show itself. The Rev. M. Conden, the priest at
Cartsdyke, Greenock, in whose church he gave a little mission
from September 14th to the 18th, writes as follows about
his stay with him:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "He preached morning and evening, heard confessions
  daily, pledged 200 young teetotallers, and received about 14
  in voluntary offerings, for which he seemed most grateful.
  This mission, he said, was his 242nd of the kind; and the
  number of his teetotallers, since he himself took the pledge
  from Father Mathew in 1842, was 60,000.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Every moment of his time here (refection hours alone
  excepted), from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., was employed either in
  the mission exercises, or at his office, or in prayer, or in
  writing letters to arrange his future movements. He never
  rested. He seemed to have vowed all his time to some duty
  or other.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Wood Cottage (late the Free Church Manse, but now
  the priest's house in Cartsdyke) rests on an eminence overlooking
  the town, harbour, and bay of Greenock, and is at a
  distance of from five to ten minutes' walk from St. Laurence's
  chapel. I noticed that the zigzag uphill walk fatigued
  him, and I offered to provide a conveyance; but he would
  not permit me, 'as he could not read his office so well in the
  carriage as when walking.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "As he passed twice or thrice daily to and from my house
  and the chapel, his massive form and mild mien, his habit
  half concealed by his cloak, his broad-brimmed hat, and his
  breviary in hand, attracted the attention of the old and the
  curiosity of the young. One day, some of the latter followed
  him and eyed him closely, through the lattice-work in front of
  the cottage, until he had finished his office in the garden. He
  then turned towards the youngsters, and riveted his looks
  on them with intense interest and thoughtfulness. You
  might have imagined that they never had seen his like before,
  and that he had seen children for the first time in his long
  life. At length one of the lads broke the spell by observing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498">{498}</a></span>
  to the others in a subdued and doubting tone, 'A big
  Hie-lander!' 'A Highlander,' said Father Ignatius, turning to
  me; 'they take my habit for an elongated kilt.'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "At dinner he was always very happy and communicative,
  that day in particular.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'My religious habit,' said he, 'subjected me to many
  humorous remarks before the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and
  to annoyances after it. One time a boy would cry out at
  me, "There's the Great Mogul;" another, "There goes
  Robinson Crusoe." "That's Napoleon," a third would
  shout; whilst a fourth, in a strange, clear, wild, musical
  tone, would sing out: "No, that's the devil himself." But,
  he continued, 'nothing half so sharp was ever said of me as
  of a very tall, lath-like Oratorian, who stood leaning, one
  day, against a wall, musing on something or nothing. Some
  London wags watched him attentively for some time,
  and, being divided in their opinions about him, one of
  them at length ended the dispute by observing, in a dry
  and droll way, "Why, that fellow must have grown by
  contract!"'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "Even after his frugal refection, Father Ignatius would
  never rest. Then, too, he must either read his breviary, or
  say his rosary, or write letters. On the day he finished his
  mission (Sunday, September 18), I besought him, as he had
  allowed himself little or no sleep since he began it, before
  proceeding to Port-Glasgow, to commence a new mission
  there that same evening, to recline on the sofa, even for
  half an hour. 'Oh no!' said he; 'I shall try to have my
  nap in the carriage, on my way.' The distance from Cartsdyke
  to Port Glasgow being no more than two or three
  miles, and there being a toll-bar about midway, he could
  have very little of his nap.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "During his mission here, he remarked repeatedly, both
  publicly and in private, that his health was never better, and
  his mind never clearer. He promised himself yet twenty
  years to work for the conversion of England, the sanctification
  of Ireland, and the unity of all in the faith. Might
  he not live to see this realized? Twenty years might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">{499}</a></span>
  do it, and were not his physical and mental powers fresh
  enough?
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But, with all this hope of heart and soul, I could, now
  and then, notice a shade of apprehension passing over his
  countenance, and hear, not without tears, his humble, but
  earnest self-reproaches at his inability to 'brighten up.'
  The manner in which he did this showed me plainly that
  he had a strong presentiment of his approaching end.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "My cottage being at some distance from my chapel, the
  bishop had allowed me to fit up in my house a little oratory,
  where I might keep the Blessed Sacrament, and say mass
  occasionally. By the time that Father Ignatius had concluded
  his mission, I had completed my oratory, and asked
  him to bless it. 'Under what title?' he asked. 'Under
  that of "Our Lady of the Seven Dolors," this (Sunday,
  September 18) being that festival of hers,' I replied. Father
  Ignatius became silent and absorbed for a considerable time
  and then said:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'Beautiful title! and appropriate! Here are the stations
  of the Cross! And this is the Feast of the Seven Dolors!
  Beautiful title!'
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "'This,' he continued, 'reminds me of what I once read
  of St. Thomas of Canterbury. When passing for the <i>last</i>
  time through France to England, he was asked, by a gentleman
  who entertained him, to bless a little oratory which
  might be a memorial of his visit. "Under what title?"
  asked the Archbishop. "I shall leave the selection to your
  grace," said the host. "Well then," rejoined the Archbishop,
  "let it be to the <i>first English martyr</i>." He was <i>himself</i> the
  first martyr.
</p>

  "'Our Lady of Dolors!' Beautiful Title! I am a Passionist.
  Here are the stations of the Cross; and this is the
  Feast of the Seven Dolors,' repeated Father Ignatius; and
  again he became absorbed and silent, so long that I thought
  he wanted never to bless my little oratory. He blessed it,
  however; and now is it by mere accident that on this,
  the eve of St. John of the Cross, Father Ignatius's disciple
  and friend, Father Alban, comes to bless the oratory cross,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">{500}</a></span>
  and set up the little memorial tablet which I have prepared
  with the following inscription?&mdash;
</p>
<p class="center">
           ORATE PRO ANIMA<br>
<br>
    REV SSMI. PATRIS IGNATII (SPENCER)<br>
  QUI DIE OCTODECIMO SEPTEMBRIS, A.D. 1864.<br>
<br>
           HOC ORATORIUM<br>
<br>
  SUB TITULO 'B. V. MARIAE DE SEPTEM DOLORIBUS,'<br>
<br>
            BENEDIXIT.<br>
<br>
             R.I.P."
</p>
<br>
<p>
In a letter to Father Joseph about this time, Father
Ignatius says:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I proceed to say that I have two more moves fixed: for
  Sunday the 18th, to Port Glasgow; Thursday the 22nd, to
  Catholic Church, East Shaw Street, Greenock. <i>During the
  week following I shall suspend missionary work, and make
  my visit to Mr. Monteith, and re-commence on Sunday
  morning, October 2nd. I have got two places to go to in
  Scotland, Leith and Portobello, and I wish to get one more
  to go to first.</i>"
</p>
<p>
This sentence we put in italics, as it seems to signify a
clear foreknowledge of his death. This one other place he
did get, and it was Coatbridge, his last mission. His letters,
after this, are more confused about his future; it would
seem his clear vision failed him. At all events, this much
may be gathered from his words, that he <i>knew</i> for certain
his dissolution was near, and <i>very probably</i> knew even the
day. There is nothing whatever in his plans for the future
to militate against this conclusion. The most definite is the
following, which we quote from his last letter to Father
Provincial, dated from Coatbridge, Sept. 28: "I <i>am going</i>
on Saturday to Leith; on Thursday, Oct. 6, to Portobello;
on Monday, Oct. 10, to Carstairs (Mr. Monteith's), for a
visit and <i>repose</i>." Did he know that repose was to be
eternal? He kept to his first arrangement about the visit;
but we must hear something about his last little mission.
</p>
<p>
We subjoin two accounts of this mission. The first was
sent us by a gentleman, Mr. M'Auley of Airdrie, who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">{501}</a></span>
attended the mission, and the next by the Rev. Mr. O'Keefe,
the priest.
</p>
<p>
Mr. M'Auley writes:
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I was witness to his missionary
  labours for the last five days of his life in this world. On
  Sunday, the 25th September, Rev. Michael O'Keefe, St.
  Patrick's Catholic Chapel, Coatbridge (a large village two
  miles from Airdrie, and eight from Glasgow), announced to
  his flock that Father Ignatius would open a mission there
  on the following Tuesday evening at eight o'clock, and close
  it on Saturday morning, 1st October. Accordingly, the
  beautiful little church was crowded on Tuesday at eight,
  when the saintly father made his appearance and addressed
  the people for upwards of an hour. He gave them a brief
  outline of his conversion, his different visits to Ireland and
  the Continent, the grand objects he had in view&mdash;namely,
  the conversion of his country to the Catholic faith, the faith
  of their fathers; as also, the conversion of Scotland and the
  sanctification of Ireland. He then showed the power of
  prayer, and said that the conversion of Great Britain could
  only be attained by prayer. He said the sanctification of
  Ireland should begin by rooting out the vices and disorders
  which prevail. These, he remarked, were drunkenness,
  cursing, and company-keeping, and that they would form
  the subjects of his discourses for the three following evenings.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "He then showed the utility of missions, and mentioned
  that this was his 245th; and closed, as he did on the subsequent
  evenings, by saying three <i>Hail Marys</i> for the
  conversion of England, one for the conversion of Scotland, and
  one for the sanctification of Ireland. Each of the first three
  was followed by, <i>Help of Christians, pray for us;</i> that for
  Scotland by, <i>St. Margaret, pray for us;</i> and that for Ireland
  by, <i>St. Patrick, pray for us</i>. He also mentioned that he
  had received from his Holiness, Pope Pius IX., an indulgence
  of 300 days for each Hail Mary said for the conversion
  of England. On the following four days he said mass
  every morning at seven o'clock, and, on the three first,
  heard confessions from six o'clock in the morning until
  eleven at night, with the exception of the time required for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">{502}</a></span>
  his devotions and meals. On Saturday morning he heard
  two confessions before mass. I was the last he heard, and
  I trust the fatherly advice he then gave me shall never be
  eradicated from my memory."
</p>
<p>
Father O'Keefe writes:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I am just in receipt of your letter, and beg to inform
  you that I have not words to express the sorrow I feel for
  the sudden death of the good and holy Father Ignatius.
  <i>Deo gratias</i>, there is one more added to the Church
  triumphant. He reached my house about five o'clock on
  the 27th ult., and left this on Saturday morning at a
  quarter-past nine o'clock, during which time he enjoyed excellent
  health. He told me that he was going direct to Leith, to
  open his little mission there on Saturday night; and thence
  to Portobello for the same purpose, after he had done at
  Leith. He also told me that, after finishing his mission at
  Portobello, he would return home to St. Anne's Retreat.
  He intended to pay a visit to Mr. Monteith this week. On
  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights he had supper
  at half-past ten o'clock, and then returned to the confessional
  until about a quarter-past eleven. On Friday night he told
  me to defer supper till eleven; yet, late though it was, he
  returned after supper to the confessional, and remained
  there until a quarter-past twelve. When he came in, I
  said: 'I am afraid, Father Ignatius, you are over-exerting
  yourself, and that you must feel tired and fatigued.' He
  said, with a smile: 'No, no; I am not fatigued. There is
  no use in saying I am tired, for, you know, I must be at
  the same work to-night in Leith.' He retired to his room
  at half-past twelve o'clock, and was in the confessional again
  at six o'clock in the morning. He said mass at seven;
  breakfasted at half-past eight; and, as I have already said,
  left this at a quarter-past nine for the train. On seeing him,
  after breakfast, in his secular dress, I remarked that he
  looked much better and younger than in his religious habit.
  The remark caused him to laugh very heartily. It was the
  only time I saw him laugh. He said: 'I wish to tell you
  what Father Thomas Doyle said when he saw me in my
  secular dress: "Father Ignatius, you look like a
{503 }
  broken-down old gentleman." And he enjoyed the remark very
  much.'"
</p>
<p>
The remainder of his life is easily told. He arrived at
Carstairs Junction at 10.35 a.m.; came out of the train,
and gave his luggage in charge of the station master. He
then went towards Carstairs House, the residence of Mr.
Monteith. There is a long avenue through the demesne for
about half a mile from the station, crossed then at right
angles by another, which leads to the grand entrance; this
avenue Father Ignatius went by. He had just passed the
"rectangle," and was coming straight to the grand entrance,
when he turned off on a bye path. He perceived that he
had lost his way, and asked a child which was the right
one. He never spoke to mortal again.
</p>
<p>
On a little corner in the avenue, just within sight of the
house, and about a hundred paces from the door, he fell
suddenly and yielded up his spirit into the hands of his
Creator. May we all die doing God's work, and as well
prepared as Father Ignatius of St. Paul!
</p>
<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">{504}</a></span>
<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br>
The Obsequies Of Father Ignatius.</h2>
<br>
<p>
The divine attribute of Providence to which he was so
fondly devoted during life guided him in his last moments.
He did not intend to visit Carstairs before the 10th of
October, but our Lord, who disposes all things sweetly,
had ordained otherwise, by the circumstances. The train
he came by was due at the junction at 10.35, and the train
for Edinburgh would not start before 11.50. He had more
than an hour to wait, and he thought perhaps he might as
well spend part of that time at Mr. Monteith's as at the
Railway Station; besides he could get a fast train to Edinburgh
at 3.0, which would bring him to Leith a few
minutes after six, and this would be time enough, as his
mission was to commence on the next day, Sunday. Such
seems to have been the simple combination of circumstances
that directed his steps to Carstairs House, as far as
human eye can see. We cannot but admire the dispositions
of Providence; had he taken any other train, he
might have died in the railway carriage, or at a station.
How convenient that he died within the boundaries of the
demesne of a friend by whom he was venerated, and to
whose house he was always welcome!
</p>
<p>
And then how remarkable was that other circumstance
of his being alone. Servants and workmen were passing
up and down the place the whole morning, but at the
moment God chose to call his servant, no human eye saw
him, and no hand was ready to assist him. On measuring
the respective distances from where he had turned off the
avenue, to where his body was found, and to the house, it
was seen that, had he gone on straight, he would have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">{505}</a></span>
fallen just on the threshold. It was God's will that angels
instead of men should surround his lonely bed of death.
</p>
<p>
He must have arrived at the spot where his body was
discovered about 11 o'clock. A few minutes after, one of
the retainers was passing by, and ran at once to the house
to give the alarm that a priest lay dead at such a part of
the avenue. Mr. Monteith, and Mr. Edmund Waterton,
who was on a visit there at the time, were going out to
shoot. They laid down their guns, and went in haste to
the spot. Monteith did not recognize the features; they
were drawn together by the death-stroke. They searched
for something to identify him. What was the good man's
surprise when he found among the papers of the deceased a
letter he had written himself to Father Ignatius a few days
before. The truth then flashed across him. It was no
other than his own godfather, his constant friend and counsellor,
the man whom he venerated so much, Father Ignatius
the Passionist. Immediately, a doctor was sent for, the
body, which all now recognized, was brought to the nearest
shelter, and every available means tried to restore consciousness,
but to no effect. Medical examination showed that he
died of disease of the heart, and in an instant. The spot
whereon he lay bore the impress of his knee, and the brim
of his hat was broken by his sudden fall on the left side.
As soon as they were certain of life being extinct, the body
was brought into the house, the luggage was sent for, a
coffin was provided, the secular dress was taken off, and the
corpse robed in the religious habit. The sacristy was draped
in black, and two flickering tapers showed the mortal remains
of a pure and saintly soul, as they lay there in a kind of
religious state for the greater part of three days.
</p>
<p>
Telegrams were sent immediately to our principal houses,
and to members of the Spencer family by Mr. Monteith. The
shock was great, and not knowing the manner of his death
did not serve to make it the less felt. Fathers of the Order
went from the different retreats to Carstairs, and arrived
there, some on Sunday, and some on Monday morning.
Those who went were struck by the appearance of the
corpse; the marble countenance never looked so noble as in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">{506}</a></span>
death, and we looked with silent wonder on all that now
remained of one whom the world was not worthy of possessing
longer.
</p>
<p>
About 10 o'clock a sad cortge was formed, and the coffin
was carried by the most worthy persons present to the train
that conveyed it to Button. Every one on hearing of his
death appeared to have lost a special friend; no one could
lament, for they felt that he was happy; few could pray for
him, because they were more inclined to ask his intercession.
The greatest respect and attention were shown by the railway
officials all along the route, and special ordinances were
made in deference to the respected burthen that was carried.
</p>
<p>
Letters were sent to the relatives of Father Ignatius by
our Father Provincial, and they were told when the funeral
would take place. No one came, and those who were sure
to come were unavoidably prevented. Lord Lucan had not
time to come from West Connaught, and Lord Spencer was
just then in Copenhagen. His regard for his revered uncle,
and his kindly spirit, will be seen from the following letter,
which was published in the newspapers at the time, and is
the most graceful tribute paid to the memory of Father
Ignatius by any member of his noble family.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "<i>Denmark, Oct</i>. 16, 1864.
<br><br>
  "Rev. Sir,&mdash;I was much shocked to hear of the death of
  my excellent uncle George. I received the sad intelligence
  last Sunday, and subsequently received the letter which you
  had the goodness to write to me. My absence from England
  prevented my doing what I should have much wished to
  have done, to have attended to the grave the remains of my
  uncle, if it had been so permitted by your Order.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I assure you that, much as I may have differed from
  my uncle on points of doctrine, no one could have admired
  more than I did the beautiful simplicity, earnest religion,
  and faith of my uncle. For his God he renounced all the
  pleasures of the world; his death, sad as it is to us, was, as
  his life, apart from the world, but with God.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "His family will respect his memory as much as I am
  sure you and the brethren of his Order do.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507">{507}</a></span>
<p class="cite">
  "I should be much obliged to you if you let me know
  the particulars of the last days of his life, and also where
  he is buried, as I should like to place them among family
  records at Althorp.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "I venture to trouble you with these questions, as I suppose
  you will be able to furnish them better than any one else.
<br><br>
    "Yours faithfully,<br>
        "SPENCER."
</p>
<p>
The evening before the funeral the coffin was opened, and
the body was found to have already commenced to decompose.
The tossing of the long journey from Scotland and
the suddenness of the death caused this change to come on
sooner than might be expected. A privileged few were
allowed to take a last lingering look at the venerable remains,
many touched the body with objects of devotion, and
others cut off a few relics which their piety valued in
proportion to their conception of his sanctity.
</p>
<p>
At 11 o'clock on Thursday, October 5th, the Office of the
Dead commenced. A requiem mass was celebrated, and the
funeral oration preached by the Right Rev. Dr. Ullathorne,
Lord Bishop of Birmingham, and particular friend of the
deceased. We give the following extracts from an account
of the funeral as given by the <i>Northern Press</i>; the Bishop's
sermon is taken from the <i>Weekly Register</i>.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  At eleven o'clock the solemn ceremonies commenced. The
  church, which was crowded, was draped in black, and the
  coffin (on which were the stole and cap of the deceased
  nobleman) reclined on a raised catafalque immediately outside
  the sanctuary rails. On each side of the coffin were
  three wax-lights, and around were ranged seats for the
  clergy in attendance. Solemn Office for the Dead was first
  chanted, and amongst the assembled clerics were the following:
  The Right Rev. Dr. Ullathorne (Lord Bishop of
  Birmingham); Benedictines: Right Rev. Dr. Burchall (Lord
  Abbot of Westminster), Very Rev. R. B. Vaughan (Prior
  of St. Michael's, Hereford), Very Rev. T. Cuthbert Smith
  (Prior of St. George's, Downside), Very Rev. P. P. Anderson
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">{508}</a></span>
  (Prior of St. Laurence's, Ampleforth); the Revds. P. A.
  Glassbrooke, R. A. Guy, J. P. Hall, and Bradshaw
  (Redemptorists); the Very Rev. Canon Wallwork, the Rev.
  Fathers Walmsley, Grimstone, Costello, Kernane (Rainhill),
  M. Duggan, M.R. (St. Joseph's, Liverpool), S. Walsh (of
  the new mission of St. John the Evangelist, Bootle); Father
  Dougall; Father Fisher, of Appleton; Father O'Flynn, of
  Blackbrook, near St. Helen's; and the priests and religious
  of the Order of Passionists, who were represented by members
  of the order from France, Ireland, and England. A
  number of nuns of the convent of the Holy Cross, Sutton,
  occupied seats beside the altar of the Blessed Virgin, and
  with them were about twenty young girls apparelled in
  white dresses and veils, with black bands round the head,
  and wearing also black scarfs. When the Office for the
  Dead had concluded, a solemn Requiem Mass was begun.
  His Lordship the Bishop of Birmingham occupied a seat on
  a raised dais at the Gospel side of the altar; and the priests
  who celebrated the Sacred Mysteries were:&mdash;Celebrant&mdash;
  the Very Rev. Father Ignatius (Paoli), Provincial of the
  Order of Passionists in England and Ireland; Deacon&mdash;
  the Very Rev. Father Eugene, First Provincial Consulter;
  Sub-deacon&mdash;the Very Rev. Father Bernard, Second Provincial
  Consulter; Master of the Ceremonies&mdash;the Very
  Rev. Father Salvian, rector of St. Saviour's Retreat,
  Broadway, Worcestershire. The mass sung was the Gregorian
  Requiem, and the choir was under the direction of the Rev.
  Father Bernardine (of Harold's Cross Retreat, Dublin, and
  formerly of Sutton). Immediately after the conclusion of
  the Holy Sacrifice, the Right Rev. Dr. Ullathorne ascended
  the pulpit (which was hung in black) and preached the
  funeral sermon.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  His Lordship, who was deeply affected, said:&mdash;
  The wailings of the chant have gone into silence, the
  cry of prayer is hushed into secret aspiration, and stillness
  reigns, whilst I lift my solitary voice, feeling, nevertheless,
  that it would be better for me to weep over my own soul
  than to essay to speak the character of him who is gone
  from the midst of us. A certain oppression weighs upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509">{509}</a></span>
  my heart, and yet there rises through it a spring of consolation
  when I think upon that strength of holiness which has
  borne him to his end; who, if I am a Religious, was my
  brother; if a Priest, he was of the Holy Order of Priesthood;
  but he was also, what I am not, a mortified member
  of an institute devoted to the Passion of our Lord, who bore
  conspicuously upon him the character of the meekness and
  the sufferings of his Divine Master.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  My text lies beneath that pall. For there is all that
  Death will ever claim of victory from him. The silver cord
  is broken, and the bowl of life is in fragments; and yet this
  death is but the rending of the mortal frame that through
  the open door the soul may go forth to its eternity; upon
  the brink of which we stand, gazing after with our faith,
  and trembling for ourselves whilst we gain a glimpse of the
  Throne of Majesty, on which sits the God of infinite purity,
  whose insufferable light searches our frailty through.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  I will not venture to recount a life which would ask days
  of speech or volumes of writing, but I will endeavour at
  least to point to some of those principles which animated
  that life, and were its stay as well as guidance. For principles
  are like the luminaries of Heaven, or like the eyes that
  cover the wings of the Cherubs that sustain the Chariot of
  God in the vision of Ezechiel. They are luminous points
  planted in the midst of our life, which enable us to see
  whatever we look upon in a new light, and to enhance the
  scene of our existence. Listen, then, dearly beloved, and
  hang your attention on my voice, whilst I speak of him
  who was once called in the world the Honourable and Rev.
  George Spencer, a scion of one of the noblest houses of the
  nobility of this land, but who himself preferred to be called
  Father Ignatius of St. Paul, of the Congregation of Regular
  Clerics of our most Holy Redeemer's Passion, a name by
  which he was loved by tens of thousands of the poor of
  these countries, and known to the Catholics of all lands.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  Father Ignatius was born in the last month of the last
  year of the last century; at the time when his father was
  First Lord of the Admiralty. Brought up in the lap of
  luxury, and encircled with those social splendours that belong
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">{510}</a></span>
  to our great families, he was educated as most of our noble
  youths are; sent early to Eton, and thence to Cambridge.
  I will not stay to trace his early life. In his twenty-second
  year he received Anglican orders, and was inducted into the
  living that adjoined the mansion of his fathers, where, for
  seven years, he toiled to disseminate to those around him
  what light of truth had entered his own mind. He himself
  has recorded that he had about 800 souls committed to his
  care. And here we begin to see the opening of that genuine
  purity and earnestness in his character which he developed
  with time to such perfection. His simplicity of
  soul and passionate love of truth enabled him to see some
  of the leading characteristics of truth in its objective nature.
  He saw that truth was one, and that the Church, which is
  the depository and the voice of truth, must of necessity be
  one. He found his parish divided by the presence of the
  sects of Unitarians, Anabaptists, and Wesleyans. These he
  sought out, conversed with them, and discussed with them
  the unity of truth and the authority of the Church. But
  the more he urged them with his arguments the more he
  found that they threw him back upon himself, forcing him
  to see, by the aid of his own sincerity and love of truth,
  that he stood upon something like the self-same grounds
  which he assailed in them. The very sincerity with which
  he read the Gospel; the sincerity with which he prayed; the
  sincerity with which he strove to penetrate into those duties
  and responsibilities which then appeared to him to be laid
  upon his conscience; and his sincere love of souls, drew
  his own soul gradually and gently towards the one broad
  horizon of truth and the one authority. He had already,
  from reading the Gospel, determined on leading a life of
  celibacy as the most pure and perfect, and to keep himself
  from the world for the service of his Divine Master. And
  what effect that resolve had in humbling his heart and
  bringing down the light and grace of God into his spirit, he
  himself has told us in that narrative of his conversion which
  he drew up at the request of a venerable Italian bishop,
  soon after his conversion. The results, I say, he has told
  us; he presumes not to point to any cause as in himself.
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">{511}</a></span>

<p class="cite">
  But whilst yet perplexed between the new light he was
  receiving, and the resistance of the old opinion which he had
  inherited, he received a letter from an unknown hand, inviting
  him to examine the foundations of his faith; this led
  to correspondence, and so to contact with members of the
  Church, and the errors which had encompassed him from his
  birth dispersed by degrees, until at last the daylight dawned
  upon him, and grew on even to mid-day, and he hesitated not,
  even for one week, but closed his ministry, and entered into
  the Church of God and the fulness of peace. Then it was
  he found that the correspondent who had awakened him to
  inquire was a lady, who, converted before himself, was then
  dying in a convent in Paris which she had but recently
  entered; and he hoped, as he said, to have an intercessor
  in heaven in one who had so fervently prayed for him on
  earth.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  No sooner had Father Ignatius entered the Church than
  he put himself with all simplicity and obedience under the
  guidance of the venerable prelate, my predecessor, Bishop
  Walsh, who sent him to Rome, there to enter on a course
  of ecclesiastical studies. In 1830, there we find him in the
  holy city, imbibing that Apostolic light, and bending himself
  over the written laws of that truth which was to fit him,
  not only for the priesthood, but also for a singular call and
  an unprecedented vocation. Father Ignatius was marked
  out by the Providence of God for a special apostleship, and
  he had something about him of the spirit of the prophet and
  of the eye of the seer. He pierced in advance into the work
  to which God called him, and there were holy souls who
  instinctively looked to him as an instrument for the fulfilling
  of their own anticipations. There was in Italy a Passionist
  Father, who from his youth had had written in his heart the
  work of England's conversion. It had been the object of
  all his thoughts, and prayers, and hopes. Father Dominic
  had moved all the souls he could with kindred ardour for
  this work. And before they had ever beheld each other, the
  hearts of those two men were sweetly drawn together. Let
  us hear what Father Dominic writes to an English gentleman,
  himself a convert, ardent for the conversion of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">{512}</a></span>
  country, on the day of Mr. Spencer's first sermon in Rome,
  after being ordained deacon:&mdash;"On this day," he writes,
  "on this day, the feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus,
  Mr. Spencer begins in Rome his apostolic ministry; to-day,
  he makes his first sermon to the Roman people in the church
  of the English. Oh what a fortunate commencement!
  Certainly that ought to be salutary which commences in the
  name of the Saviour. Oh, how great are my expectations!
  God, without doubt, has not shed so many graces on that
  soul to serve for his own profit alone. I rather believe He
  has done it in order that he might carry the Holy Name of
  Jesus before kings, and nations, and the sons of Israel. Most
  sweet Name of Jesus, be thou in his mouth as oil poured
  out, which may softly and efficaciously penetrate the hardest
  marble."

  This was written by a man who had never stepped on
  English soil, about one whom he had never seen in the flesh,

  heart God had written in grace the words&mdash;<i>England's Conversion</i>.

  It was whilst yet a Deacon, that Father Ignatius was
  visited at the Roman College by a Bishop who had come to
  Rome from the farthest corner of Italy, who on his soul had
  also the impression that great conversions were in store for
  England, and who asked that his eyes might be blessed
  with so rare a spectacle as that of a converted Anglican
  minister; and it was at the request of the Bishop of
  Oppido, for the edification of his flock, to whom the news
  had reached, that Father Ignatius wrote the narrative of
  his conversion; the translation of which brings us in view
  of another of those remarkable men who were then preparing
  themselves for entering on the work of the English
  mission, for that translation was done in Rome by Dr.
  Gentili.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  It was under the direction of Cardinal Wiseman, then
  President of the English College, that Father Ignatius was
  pursuing his studies, when, at the end of two years, he
  broke a blood-vessel, and was summoned, in consequence,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">{513}</a></span>
  by Bishop Walsh, to hasten his ordination and return to
  England. Cardinal Wiseman arranged that he should receive
  the order of priesthood from the Cardinal Vicar in
  that very Church of St. Gregory, from which the Apostles
  of England had been sent to our shores, and that he should
  say his first mass on the Feast of that Venerable Bede,
  whose name is so intimately entwined with the literature,
  the religion, and the history of England. How Father
  Ignatius himself viewed these signs and his approaching
  ordination, he himself expressed in a letter to Father
  Dominic, in these terms: "Ten days ago I received orders
  from my Bishop, Dr. Walsh, to proceed to England without
  delay. You know the value and security of obedience, and
  will agree with me that I ought not to doubt of anything.
  The first festival day that presented itself for ordination was
  that of St. Philip Neri. Judge, then, what was my joy
  when, after that day had been fixed upon, I discovered that
  it was also the Feast of St. Augustine, the first Apostle of
  England, sent by St. Gregory. It seems to me that Providence
  wishes to give me some good omens. It is enough, if
  I have faith and humility."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  Of the grace of humility, that virtue of the heroic virtues
  which had already taken possession of his heart, I cannot
  give you better proof than his own communing with the
  heart of Father Dominic, who had hinted rumours of his
  rising to ecclesiastical dignities. He writes in reply: "I
  can assure you it would give me the greatest displeasure.
  My prayer is that God would grant me a life like that of
  His Son and the Apostles, in poverty and tribulations for
  the Gospel. I must submit, if it be His will to raise me to
  any high worldly dignity; but it would be to me the same
  as to say that I am unworthy of the heavenly state, which I
  long for upon earth. Jesus Christ sent the Apostles in
  poverty. St. Francis Xavier, St. Dominic, and so many
  other great missionaries, preached in poverty, and I wish to
  do the same, if it be the will of God."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  Here you behold the heart of this ecclesiastic, so young
  as yet in the Church, yet so mature in spiritual sense. On
  his return home, he meets his dear friend Father Dominic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">{514}</a></span>
  face to face for the first time, in the diocese of Lucca, and
  the latter writes to his friend in England:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "How willingly would I go to England along with dear
  Mr. Spencer; but the time destined by the Divine mercy
  for this has not yet arrived. I hope, however, that it will
  arrive. I hope one day to see with my own eyes that kingdom,
  which for so many years I have borne engraven on my
  heart. May God be merciful to us both, that so we may
  meet together in the company of all our dear Englishmen
  above in heaven, to praise and bless the Divine Majesty
  throughout all ages."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  I have lingered upon the first communing together of
  these two men, because it is so instructive to see how it
  was not merely in the schools, even where religion was
  studied under the shadow of the successor of St. Peter, but
  still more by drawing fire from the hearts of saintly men,
  that Father Ignatius was prepared for his future work.
  Returned to England, he has left it on record how affectionately
  he was received by his venerable father and his noble
  brother, Lord Althorp, then in the midst of his official
  career as a chief leader of the destinies of his country. Who
  that remembers those days does not recall the amenities of a
  character of humanity so gentle and true, that even in the
  midst of the most intense political strife he embittered no
  one, and drew on him no personal attack. By his noble
  relatives, Father Ignatius was received with the old affection,
  and their entire conduct towards him was an exception
  indeed to the treatment which so many members of other
  families have experienced in reward for their fidelity to
  God and to their conscience. For fifteen years Father
  Ignatius toiled in the work of the mission in the diocese of
  Birmingham, generously expending both himself and the
  private funds allowed him by his family in the service of
  souls. He founded the mission of Westbromwich, and the
  mission of Dudley; he raised there churches and schools,
  and preached and conversed with the poor unceasingly. He
  was called to Oscott, and a new office was created for him,
  that of Spiritual Dean, that he might inspire those young
  men who were preparing for the ministry with his own
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515">{515}</a></span>
  missionary ardours. The office began with him, and ended
  when he left the establishment, although unquestionably
  one of the greatest functions which could be exerted in our
  colleges would be the office of enkindling in youthful hearts
  that fire of charity for souls which is the true creator of
  the missioner. But the time was coming when he was to
  pass from the ordinary life of a missioner, led in an
  extraordinary manner, and to pass into that religious
  congregation where he was to carry out his special mission, his
  Apostleship of prayer. During those fifteen past years he
  had not lost sight of Father Dominic. In 1840, that holy
  man, with the name of England written on his heart,
  reached Boulogne with a community of his brethren. In
  the same year he visited Oscott, where those two men of
  God embraced each other anew; and in the following year
  the desire and prayer of so many years was realized. The
  Passionist Fathers were established at Aston, in Staffordshire,
  with Father Dominic as their head and founder; and
  whoever will look over the correspondence, so deeply interesting
  at this moment, which is printed as an appendix to
  the life of the Blessed Paul of the Cross, will see how great
  a part the Rev. George Spencer had in the work of bringing
  the Passionists into England.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  It was in the year 1846, that, making a retreat under the
  Fathers of the Society of Jesus, God revealed to his heart
  his vocation to join the Passionists, and become the companion
  and fellow worker with Father Dominic. He cast
  himself at the feet of that holy man, and petitioned for the
  singular grace of being admitted to the Order. Their joint
  aspirations for England had brought them together, and
  their love of the Cross made them of one mind, and after
  the first ironic rebuff with which the spirit of the petitioner
  was tested, I can imagine the smile with which that man of
  God, so austere to himself whilst so loving to his neighbour,
  recalled the time, long past, when they wondered if ever
  they should meet in the flesh face to face. There before
  him was the man drawn by his prayers into his very bosom,
  of whom he had predicted, sixteen years ago, that he would
  carry the name of Jesus for the conversion of England
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516">{516}</a></span>
  before the kings and nations of the earth. In the Order he
  was distinguished by his simplicity, his humility, his
  self-mortification, his patience in suffering, and his obedience.
  I would gladly dwell on the traits of those virtues which
  formed his personal character, but time urges me to proceed.
  He filled successively the office of Consultor, of Novice-master,
  and of Rector, and it was to him that Father
  Dominic provisionally consigned his authority at his death.
  But his great and singular work was his Apostleship of
  prayer for England. Many had been the questionings in
  many hearts, as to whether this country would ever in any
  serious numbers return to the faith or not. And many had
  been the speculations as to how this could be accomplished;
  some dreamt it must come by missions; others, by learned
  writings; others, by the preaching of the Gospel; some had
  one scheme, some another, but in each there was something
  defective, something not altogether divine; something that
  was human, and resting more or less on the will of man.
  But Father Ignatius consulted the light and grace of his
  own soul, he penetrated to the true principle, he recalled his
  own history, he saw that conversion is the work of God,
  that the work itself is the work of grace, and that all that
  man can do, is to invoke God to put forth His power. Prayer
  that is pure, sincere, earnest, and of many souls, God always
  hears and inclines to grant. There are many ways of
  approaching to God, but there is one which He loves for its
  tender alliance with the Divine Humanity, for its humility
  and its beautiful faith, and that is the approach through her
  who is at once the Virgin Mother of God and ours. Let
  us plead to God through the Mother of God, and let her
  plead for her sons on earth to her Son in Heaven, and behold
  our prayer is tripled in its strength. So Ignatius looked to
  God through the eyes of Mary, prayed to God through the
  heart of Mary, and appealed through the purity of Mary,
  for a people who had forgotten her. And he went forth on
  his Apostleship of prayer over Italy and France, and Hungary
  and Austria, and the rest of Germany; and over
  Belgium and England, and Ireland and Scotland, and he
  corresponded with the other kingdoms of Christendom. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517">{517}</a></span>
  went before emperors and kings, and before ministers of
  state, and asked them to pray for the conversion of his
  country. He sought the Bishops in their dioceses, and the
  priests in their parishes, and holy religious in their convents,
  and devout lay persons in their houses, and prayed them to
  pray to God, and to set other souls to pray for the conversion
  of England. His faith was strong that from her conversion
  a great radiation of truth would spread forth in the
  world, and that all that was needed was the general prayer
  of believing souls, that God might grant so great a grace to
  the world. And so the name of Father Ignatius grew
  familiar on the lips of Christendom. Prayer arose in many
  countries; the Bishops issued pastorals, a day in the week
  was appointed for prayer for England. Prelates spoke of it
  in synods, and the clergy discussed it in their conferences.
  And all pious souls added on new prayers to their habitual
  devotions for the conversion of England. And as for the
  apostle of this prayer, he went on nourishing the flame
  which he had enkindled, and stirring the zeal of his brethren
  until, to use his own words, often repeated to his superior,
  this prayer, and the preaching of this prayer to God through
  Mary, had become a part of his nature, an element inseparable
  from his existence. He had but recently recommenced
  the work of this mission in a somewhat altered form, basing
  the conversion of the English upon the sanctification of the
  Irish people, but still his cry was&mdash;Pray for England. There
  can be no doubt, as sundry facts point out, but that he had
  a strong impression of late that his end was drawing near.
  And not long before his death he called the brethren individually
  to his room, and exhorted each with solemn earnestness
  to be instant in the mission of prayer for England.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  And what has been the result of this Apostleship? That
  result Father Ignatius himself summed up but a few days
  before his death. On the 8th of September, he addressed a
  letter to an Italian periodical, from which I translate the
  following passage as the fit conclusion of this subject. He
  says:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is more than thirty-four years since a worthy Bishop
  of a Neapolitan diocese came to seek me in the English
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518">{518}</a></span>
  College at Rome, wishing to look with his own eyes upon a
  converted Anglican clergyman; a sight so grateful to a
  noble Catholic heart, and in those days so rare. On what
  proof he spoke, I know not, but he assured me that the
  first Carmelite Scapular ever given, and given by that English
  Saint, Simon Stock, was secretly kept in England, and
  that he looked on this as a pledge that our country would
  one day come back to the faith. Be this assertion well or
  ill founded, the memory of him who made it is dear to me
  as is the memory of the presence of every one who bespeaks
  hope and peace for England.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "What have we seen in our days? Conversions to the
  faith so numerous and so important that the whole world
  speaks of them. And this movement towards Catholicism
  is of a character so remarkable, that the history of the
  Church presents nothing like it.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "It is true that other nations have been converted,
  whilst England has stood to her Protestantism; but a first
  step has been made in this country, which, as far as I know,
  has no parallel. In other cases, it was the sovereign who
  made the first movement, having had no learned opposition
  or persecution from his subjects; and, as in the instance of
  St. Stephen, of Hungary, the conversions which followed
  came easily, and as it were naturally; or conversion began
  with the poor, who, though it cost them persecution and
  privation, had yet but little to lose. But this has not been
  the case in England. Here the work of conversion grew
  conspicuous among the ministers of the Protestant Church,
  of whom hundreds of the most esteemed and learned have
  been received into the bosom of the Church, and also among
  the noble and the gentle families of the kingdom; so that it
  may be said that scarcely is there a family that is not
  touched by conversion, in some near or more distant member
  of it. I say that this order of conversion is new, this
  operation of grace is most singular. Great numbers of
  those clergymen had prospects before them by remaining in
  Protestantism, flattering enough, of earthly felicity, wealth,
  and honour; and by their conversion they fell upon poverty,
  distress, and contempt, especially those men who, by reason
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519">{519}</a></span>
  of their families, could not embrace the clerical state.
  The sacrifices of the lay gentry have not always been so
  great; but even here how many have closed against themselves
  the path of honours and distinctions; how many have
  been discarded by their kindred and friends; how many of
  the gentle sex have abandoned the prospect of a settlement
  in life befitting their rank and station; while all have
  turned from the world to obey the voice of God; and that,
  in a country like this, where the world holds out allurements
  so specious and so attractive in every kind.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  "But these great results can neither be attributed to
  the force, the eloquence, or the industry of man. Man has
  positively had no part in the work, except by prayer, and
  this praying has been professedly offered to God through
  Mary; through whom all the heresies of the world are
  destroyed."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  I have no time to dwell upon this summary of results so
  beautifully told and so remarkably timed. But it is impossible
  not to notice that the great tide of conversion that
  has flowed so unusually, has passed through the two classes
  to which Father Ignatius himself belonged, that of the clergy
  and that of the gentry. It is a wonderful result following
  a most unprecedented combination of the voices of Catholic
  souls of many nations in prayer, set in motion by the very
  man who is summing up the result of the work, before he
  goes to his reward; nor do I believe, although his tongue is
  silent, and his features settled into cold obstruction, as we
  looked on them last night, that the prayer of his soul has
  ceased; no, his work goes on, his Apostleship is not dead.
  Purged by the sacrifice, I seem to see his spirit all this time.
  For you know that when a holy man quits this life, and has
  not loved it as he has loved God, he goes away no further
  than God, and God is very near to us. Have you never lost
  a dear parent or a child, and have you not found that when
  freed from the body the spirit of that one had more power
  over you; seemed to be freer to be with you at all solemn
  times, and to impress you with its purely spiritual qualities
  and virtues, all gross things having ceased though the purification
  of death and the final grace? and so I conceive his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520">{520}</a></span>
  spirit standing by my side and saying still, at each interval
  of my voice,&mdash;"Pray for England: pray for her conversion."
  To you, fathers of the rude frieze, brethren of his Order,
  with the name of Christ on your breast, and the love of His
  passion in your heart, he says&mdash;"Pray for England: pray
  for her conversion." Superiors of the Benedictine Order,
  whom a special circumstance has brought here to-day, Father
  President-General, representative of St. Benedict, as of St.
  Augustine, and monastic successor of that first Apostle of
  England, to you, and to you, Priors of the Order, he says&mdash;
  "Fail not from the work of your forefathers, pray for England:
  pray for her conversion." To you, brethren of the
  priesthood, men consecrated to this mission, who know his
  voice familiarly, to you he says with the burning desire of
  his heart,&mdash;"Pray for England: pray for her conversion."
  Daughters of the virginal veil, who are his children, whilst
  in the inferior soul you suffer the grief of loss, in your
  superior soul you rejoice that he is with God; to you
  also he says:&mdash;"Pray for England: pray for her conversion."
  Dearly beloved brethren, how often in his missions
  and his ministries has he written those words upon your
  hearts. Let them not die out. Let them live on with
  something of his flame of charity. Be you as his missioners;
  carry these words to your children and your brethren. He
  prays yet, and will ever pray until the work be finished.
  Even in the presence of his God, neither the awe nor the
  majesty of that unspeakable presence can I conceive as
  interrupting the prayer which has become a portion of his
  nature&mdash;"God, have mercy on England. Turn, O Jesus,
  Thy meek eyes upon that people. Let pity drop from Thy
  glorious wounds, and mercy from Thy heart. In what she
  is blind, in what she sins, forgive her, for she knows not
  what she does. Have mercy on England." When joined
  to his beloved Dominic, and with blessed Paul, and meeting
  Gregory, and Augustine, and Bede, I conceive him urging
  them to join yet more earnestly with the prayers he left
  ascending from the earth, following his mission still in the
  heavens; nay, even pressing to be heard in the circles of
  the angels, whose meekness and purity he loved so well, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">{521}</a></span>
  still his cry is: "Pray for England: pray for her conversion."
</p>
<p class="cite">
  It remains for us to turn one last look upon his mortal
  remains, to consider our own mortality, and to prepare us
  for our approaching end. How beautiful, how sublime was
  his departure. Father Ignatius had often wished and prayed
  that, like his Divine Lord, like St. Francis Xavier, and like
  his dear friend and master in the spiritual life, Father
  Dominic, he might die at his post, yet deserted and alone.
  God granted him that prayer. He had just closed one mission
  and was proceeding to another; he turned aside for an hour
  on his way to converse with a dear friend and godson; he
  was seen ten minutes before conversing with children. Was
  he only inquiring his way, or did he utter the last words of
  his earthly mission to those young hearts? And here alone,
  unseen but of God and His angels, he fell down, and that
  heart which had beaten so long for the love and conversion
  of England stopped in his bosom. Crucified was he in his
  death as in his life to this world, that he might live to God.

When his lordship, the Bishop, descended from the pulpit,
the procession to the place of burial was formed, and issued
from the church in the following order, the choir singing
the <i>Miserere</i>:&mdash;

the <i>Miserere</i>, and when the procession arrived at the vault,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">{522}</a></span>
the coffin (which was of deal) was placed inside a leaden
one, which was again enclosed in an outer shell of oak.
Upon this was a black plate, bearing the following inscription:&mdash;

  TRANSLATION.
</p>
<p class="cite">
  The mortal remains of Father Ignatius of St. Paul, belonging
  to the Congregation of the Passion, and of the noble
  family of Spencer. He was at first an Anglican minister;
  then, having been converted to the Catholic Church, was
  ordained into the priesthood at Rome in the year 1832. It
  is wonderful with what constancy of mind for more than
  thirty years he laboured for the conversion of his country.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523">{523}</a></span>
  He was numbered among the sons of the Passion in the
  year 1847, and always presented an example of all virtues
  to his brethren. He travelled through England, Ireland,
  Scotland, and even Italy, Germany, and France, exhorting
  the people to their own sanctification, and forming themselves,
  as it were, into a sacred army, to pour forth prayers
  for the conversion of England. While he was prosecuting
  his pleasing work in Scotland, on the 1st of October, 1864,
  and, having offered up the sacrifice of the mass, he was going
  on a visit to a friend he had long been acquainted with (Mr.
  Robert Monteith), when he was carried off by sudden death
  in front of his friend's door, being assisted by God, whose
  glory he had ever sought, and by the angels whose purity he
  had imitated. He closed his life in the 65th year of his
  age. May he rest in peace."
</p>
<p>
When all the arrangements were completed, the coffin was
placed upon the tier appropriated for its reception, and the
bishop and clergy retired.
</p>
<p>
Thus has ended the life of one who for fifteen years pursued
his missionary work, as a priest of the Order of the
Passion, with an ardour that has seldom been surpassed.
Truly may it be said of him, "Dying, he lives."
</p>
<p>
Favours are said to have been obtained from heaven
through his intercession, since his death; and it is even
recorded that miracles have been performed by his relics.
These facts have not been, as yet, sufficiently authenticated
for publication; and, therefore, it is judged better not to
insert them. We confidently hope that a few years will see
him enrolled in the catalogue of saints, as the first English
Confessor since the Reformation.
</p>
<p>
Every step we make, as we recede from this last scene,
brings us nearer to the moment when the requiescat ought
to be heard over ourselves. For
</p>
<pre>
    "The pride of luxury, the pomp of power,
       And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
     Await alike the inevitable hour;&mdash;
       The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
</pre>
<p>
How vain is a life spent in pursuit of riches! when the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524">{524}</a></span>
shroud that envelops our bones will have to be given us.
How vain are the appliances of comfort and pleasure which
wealth can spread around us! when the body we pamper is
to be the food of worms. How vain, is power and extent of
territory! when the snapping of the thread of our existence
will leave us completely in the hands of others, and confine
us to less than seven feet of earth.
</p>
<p>
Let the example of the holy Passionist, whose life we
studied, make us recognise this truth, before it is too late&mdash;
that all is vanity but the service of God. He tasted the
sweets of this world until he found out their bitterness;
let his example deter others from plunging into the whirl of
dissipation, from which few can come out uninjured. He
laid down his honours, his titles, his property, at the foot
of the cross, and he joyfully placed <i>its</i> transverse beams
upon his shoulder. There was nothing this world could
give him which he did not sacrifice unhesitatingly. He
never took back from the altar a single particle of the
offerings he placed upon it. Since the moment he understood
that the end of his existence was the happiness of the
blessed, he went straight to his eternal goal, and turned not
to the right hand nor to the left. God was always in his
mind; God was on his lips; God was in his works. We
cannot admire his sacrifices, for it would be a mistake to
suppose his mind was not noble enough to feel that all he
could give was only a barter of earth for heaven.
</p>
<p>
Let the world applaud its heroes, and raise expensive
monuments to remind others of their renown. Father
Ignatius sought not the praise of the world; its frowns
were all he desired. He looked not for its sympathy, he
crossed its ways, he gave the lie to its maxims, he trampled
it under his feet. But the servants of God will not forget
him. They will turn off the high road to come as pilgrims
to the spot where his pure soul left its earthly tenement.
To mark out the place, Mr. Monteith has erected a cross
upon the corner of the avenue where the saintly father fell.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
